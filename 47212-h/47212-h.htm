<h2>NOTE</h2>


<p>The present volume, which concludes Dubnow's "History
of the Jews in Russia-Poland," contains, in addition to the
text, an extensive bibliography and an index to the entire work.
In the bibliography an enormous amount of material has been
collected, and it is arranged in such a way as to enable the
reader to ascertain the sources upon which the author drew.
It is thus in the nature of notes, and is therefore arranged
according to the chapters of the book. The index, which has
been prepared with the utmost care by the translator, is really
a synopsis of Jewish history in Russia and Poland, and its
usefulness cannot be over-rated.</p>

<p>Professor Friedlaender, the translator of this work, who
left the United States at the beginning of this year, did not
see the proof of the bibliography and index.</p>

<p>The tragic news has just reached this country that Professor
Friedlaender was murdered under the most revolting circumstances.
An eminent scholar and writer has thus been removed
from American Jewry, and the entire house of Israel
together with the Jewish Publication Society of America, on
whose committee Professor Friedlaender served with conspicuous
merit for a number of years, mourns this irreparable
loss.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI</a><br />

THE ACCESSION OF NICHOLAS II.</h2>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">Continued Policy of Oppression</span></h3>

<p>In the course of the nineteenth century every change of
throne in Russia was accompanied by a change of policy. Each
new reign formed, at least in its beginning, a contrast to the
one which had preceded it. The reigns of Alexander I. and
Alexander II. marked a departure in the direction of liberalism;
those of Nicholas I. and Alexander III. were a return
to the ideas of reaction. In accordance with this historic
schedule, Alexander III. should have been followed by a sovereign
of liberal tendencies. But in this case the optimistic
expectations with which the new ruler was welcomed both by
his Russian and his Jewish subjects were doomed to disappointment.
The reign of Nicholas II. proved the most gloomy and
most reactionary of all. A man of limited intelligence, he
attempted to play the r&ocirc;le of an unlimited autocrat, fighting
in blind rage against the cause of liberty.</p>

<p>This reactionary tendency came to light in the very beginning
of the new reign. During the first few months after the
accession of Nicholas II. to the throne&mdash;between November,
1894, and January, 1895&mdash;the liberal Zemstvo assemblies of
nine governments,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in presenting addresses of loyalty to the new
Tzar, were bold enough to voice the hope that he would eventually
invite the representatives of these autonomous institutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
to participate in the legislative acts of the Government. This
first timid request for constitutional rights met with a harsh
and clumsy rebuff. In his reply to the deputation representing
the nobility, the Zemstvos, and the municipalities, which
appeared in the Winter Palace on January 17, 1895, to convey
to him the greetings of the Russian people, the Tzar made the
following pronouncement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In several Zemstvo assemblies there have been heard lately the
voices of men carried away by preposterous delusions concerning
the participation of the representatives of the Zemstvos in the
affairs of the inner administration. Let everybody know that I
shall guard the principle of autocracy as firmly and uncompromisingly
as it was guarded by my never-to-be-forgotten deceased
parent.</p></div>

<p>This veiled threat was enough to intimidate the faint-hearted
constitutionalists. It was universally felt that the autocratic
r&eacute;gime was still firmly entrenched and that the old constitution
of "enforced safety"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;this charter of privileges bestowed
upon the police to the disadvantage of the people&mdash;was still
unshaken. The hope of seeing Russia transformed from a
state based upon brute force into a body politic resting upon law
and order was dashed to the ground.</p>

<p>The Jews, too, were quick to realize that the war which had
been waged against them by Alexander III. for fourteen long
years was far from being at an end. True, the addresses of
welcome presented in 1895 by the Jewish communities of Russia
to the young Tzar on the occasion of his marriage elicited
an official expression of thanks, which was not marred by any
rebuke for harboring "preposterous delusions." But this was
purely for the reason that these addresses were not tainted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
any allusions to the hopes for emancipation entertained by the
Jews. There was nothing, indeed, which might have warranted
such hopes. The same dignitaries who, under Alexander III.,
had stood forth as the champions of savage anti-Semitic
policies, remained at the helm of Russian affairs: Pobyedonostzev,
the head of the Holy Synod, Durnovo, the Minister
of the Interior&mdash;towards the end of 1895 he made room for
Goremykin, who was not a whit less reactionary&mdash;and Witte,
the double-faced Minister of Finance, who was anxious at that
time to fall in line with the reactionary influences then in
vogue. The thoughts which occupied Pobyedonostzev's mind
at the beginning of the new reign may be gauged from the
report submitted by him to the Tzar in 1895, concerning the
state of affairs in the Greek-Orthodox Church. The "Grand
Inquisitor" was deeply worried by the alleged fact that the
Jews were exercising a dangerous influence over the religious
life of their Christian domestics:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The minors, after living among Jews for several years, prove
entirely forgetful of the Greek-Orthodox faith. But even the
beliefs of the adults are being undermined. The priests who
listen to the confessions of the domestics employed in Jewish
homes are stricken with horror on learning of the abominable
blasphemies uttered by the Jews against Christianity, the Savior,
and the Holy Virgin, which, through the domestics, are likely to
gain currency among the people.</p></div>

<p>These charges, which might have been bodily quoted from
the sinister writings of the medi&aelig;val guardians of the Church,
were intended as a means of preparing the young sovereign
for a proper understanding of the Jewish problem. They
were brought forward by the procurator-in-chief of the Holy
Synod, the same ecclesiastical functionary who inflicted severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
persecutions on the Russian dissidents and soon afterwards
forced the Dukhobortzy, an Evangelistic sect, to leave their
native land and to seek refuge in Canada. Having failed
to realize his great ambition&mdash;to clear Russia of its Jewish
population, with the help of Baron Hirsch's millions<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;Pobyedonostzev
resumed his professional duties, which were
those of a procurator<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of Jewry on behalf of the Holy Synod,
the <i>sanctum officium</i> of the militant Greek-Orthodox Church.</p>

<p>Not content with brandishing his rusty ecclesiastical sword,
Pobyedonostzev resorted to secular weapons in his fight against
the hated tribe. When, in 1898, the Council of the Jewish
Colonization Association in Paris sent a delegation to St.
Petersburg to apply to the Government for permission to settle
Russian Jews as agricultural farmers in Russia itself, Pobyedonostzev
replied: "Nos cadres ne sont pas pr&ecirc;ts pour vous
recevoir,"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and he went out of his way to explain to the delegates
that the Jews were a very clever people, intellectually and
culturally superior to the Russians, and, therefore, dangerous to
them: "The Jews are displacing us, and this does not suit
us." When questioned as to the future of Russian Jewry under
the system of uninterrupted persecutions, Pobyedonostzev on
one occasion made the following candid statement: "One-third
will die out, one-third will leave the country, and one-third
will be completely dissolved in the surrounding
population."</p>

<p>Such being the attitude towards the Jewish problem of the
ruling spheres of Russia, any improvement in the situation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>Russian Jewry was manifestly out of the question. Even where
such an improvement might have been found to tally with the
anti-Semitic policies of the Government, it was ruled out as
soon as it bade fair to benefit the Jews. Thus, when in 1895,
the governor of Vilna, in his "most humble report" to
the Tzar, advocated the desirability of abrogating the Pale
of Settlement for the purpose "of weakening the detrimental
influence of Jewry," since the latter constituted a majority of
the population in the cities of the Western region,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Nicholas II.
penned the following resolution:<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> "I am far from sharing
this view of the governor." The leaders of Russian Jewry
knew full well that the wind which was blowing from the
heights of the Russian throne was unfavorable to them, and
their initial hopefulness gave way speedily to a feeling of
depression. A memorandum drafted at that time by prominent
Jews of St. Petersburg, with the intention of submitting
it to one of the highest functionaries at the Russian court,
mirrors this pessimistic frame of mind:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Russian Jews are deprived of that powerful lever for
intellectual and moral advancement which is designated as the
hope for a better future. They are fully aware of the fact that the
highest authority in the land, influenced by the distorted information
concerning the Jews, which is systematically presented to it
by officials acting from avaricious or other selfish motives, is
exceedingly unfavorable to the Jews. They must resign themselves
to the fact that there is actually no possibility of directing the
attention of the Tzar and Sovereign to the true state of affairs, and
that even those dignitaries who themselves act justly and tolerantly
towards the Jews are afraid of putting in a good word for
them for fear of being charged with favoritism towards them.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The Martyrdom of the Moscow Community</span></h3>

<p>The attitude which officials of high rank were prone to
adopt towards the Jews was luridly illustrated at that time
in Moscow. It will be remembered that the small Jewish
colony which had been left in the second Russian capital after
the cruel expulsions of 1891 was barred from holding religious
services in its large synagogue which had been closed
by order of Alexander III.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In view of the forthcoming festivities
in honor of the coronation of Nicholas II., which were to be
held in Moscow in the spring of 1896, the representatives of the
Jewish community of the second Russian capital petitioned the
governor-general of Moscow, Grand Duke Sergius Alexandrovitch,
to secure for them the Tzar's permission to have their
synagogue open at least during the coronation days, "as a special
act of grace, in order that the Jews of Moscow may be given
a chance to celebrate the joyful event with due solemnity."
But the grand duke, maddened by Jew-hatred, notified the
petitioners through the Chief of Police that their petition was
"an insolent violation of the imperial will" and could not be
considered.</p>

<p>The martyrdom of the Moscow community, the heritage of
the past reign, stood out like a black stain even upon the
gloomy background of the new era. An imperial ukase issued
in 1892 had decreed that the structure of the sealed-up Moscow
synagogue should be sold to the highest bidder unless it
was converted into a charitable institution.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The community
was naturally anxious to prevent the desecration of its sanctuary
and to preserve the edifice for better days to come.
With this end in view it placed in the synagogue building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>the trade school for Jewish children which had been established
in memory of Alexander II. The anti-Semitic
authorities of Moscow scented in this step a wicked design.
The governor-general got into communication with the Ministers
of the Interior and of Public Instruction, and, as a
result, on May 27, 1896, the executive board of the Moscow
community received the following order: To stop the admission
of pupils to the trade school and to close the school altogether
after the completion of the prescribed course of studies
by the present contingent of students. Thereupon the Jews of
Moscow made another attempt to save their synagogue by transferring
hither their school and asylum for poor and orphaned
children, the so-called Talmud Torah. This attempt, too, was
frustrated by the Muscovite Hamans. On October 28, 1897,
the governor-general announced that, after consultation with
the Minister of the Interior, the decision had been reached to
close the asylum, which sheltered about one hundred poor
children, on the fanciful ground that these children might just
as well receive their instruction in Russian educational establishments.
The underlying motive of the new order was unmistakably
revealed in its latter part: Unless in the course of two
months the building of the synagogue will be reconstructed and
so altered as to be fitted for a hospital or a similar charitable
institution, it will be sold at public auction.</p>

<p>Once more the Jewish community endeavored to save its
sanctuary, which its enemies had made up their minds to destroy.
The synagogue structure was rebuilt to meet the purposes
of a hospital and a shelter. But the commission appointed
by the governor-general to examine the alterations found that
they were not sufficiently extensive and therefore suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
that the interior of the synagogue should be entirely remodelled
so as to exclude the possibility of its ever being used for devotional
purposes. The struggle centering around the alterations
dragged on for another eight years&mdash;until the revolution of
1905 and the assassination of the ferocious governor-general.
It was then that the Jews finally succeeded in releasing their
sanctuary from the death sentence which had been passed
upon it.</p>

<p>The motive which animated the Muscovite Jew-haters
was perfectly evident: it was their fervent desire to wipe out
the last remnants of the local Jewish community by subjecting
the Jews to religious and administrative persecutions and
thereby compelling them to flee from the center of Greek
Orthodoxy. The growth of the Jewish settlement at Moscow
was checked in ruthless fashion. The Jewish artisans had
been expelled as far back as 1891, but the Jewish merchants
who purchased their right of residence in the second Russian
capital at the annual cost of one thousand rubles&mdash;the tax
levied on first guild members&mdash;had been allowed to remain.
Moreover, as the largest industrial center of Russia, Moscow
naturally attracted a goodly number of Jewish merchants who
came there temporarily on business. These "newcomers"
were handled more severely than are alien enemies in war-time.
Police detectives prowled about on the streets and at the railroad
stations, seizing passers-by who happened to exhibit a
"Semitic" countenance, and dragging them to the police stations,
"with a view to the examination of their right of residence
in Moscow." The unfortunate Jews, whose documents
did not comply with all the technicalities of the law, were expelled
at once. The <i>Moscow Police News</i> carried a regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
advertisement offering a reward for the capture of "rightless"
Jews. In October, 1897, the Moscow Chief of Police announced
a premium of equal amount for the capture of one Jew or of
two burglars.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Finally, the Russian Government took a most effective
step towards preventing the increase of the Jewish population
of Moscow. On January 22, 1899, an imperial ukase was issued
forthwith prohibiting Jewish merchants of the first guild from
settling in Moscow, unless they shall have obtained special
permission from the Minister of Finance and from the governor-general
of Moscow, it being beforehand agreed that no
such permission should be granted. The same ukase enacted a
number of offensive discriminations against the Jewish merchants
already settled in Moscow by depriving them of their
vote in the commercial associations, and by other similar
devices. On a subsequent occasion the admission was candidly
made that all these measures were prompted by the desire "to
rid as far as possible the government of Moscow of the Jews
already settled there on a legal basis."</p>


<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Restrictions in the Right of Residence</span></h3>

<p>Whereas the r&eacute;gime of Grand Duke Sergius in Moscow represented
an acute stage of Jud&aelig;ophobia, manifesting itself
in cruelties of an exceptional character, the central Government
in St. Petersburg exhibited the same disease in a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
"normal" form. Here, the oppression of the Jews was pursued
systematically and quietly, and was carried on as one of
the most important functions of the public administration.
The sacrosanct institution of the Pale of Settlement and the
other mainstays of political anti-Semitism were zealously
guarded by the faithful watchdogs of Russian reaction&mdash;the
various Ministers of the Interior who followed one another
between the years 1895 and 1904: Durnovo (until the autumn
of 1895), Goremykin (1896-1899), Sipyaghin (1899-1902),
and Plehve (1902-1904). True, during the r&eacute;gime of the last
two Ministers the anti-Semitic temperature rose above normal,
but it was only due to the fact that the increased revolutionary
propaganda of those days had generally stimulated the powers
of reaction to a greater display of energy. Quite aside
from these exceptional conditions, the rigid consistency in enforcing
the restrictive laws was sufficient to account for many
tragedies in the life of the Jews, while the despotism of the
provincial authorities aggravated the situation still further
and turned the tragedies into catastrophes.</p>

<p>As far as the Pale of Settlement is concerned, the Government
continued its old-time policy of cooping up the Jews
within the area of the cities and towns by shielding the villages
carefully against the influx of Jews. Since the promulgation
of the "Temporary Rules" in 1882, the authorities of St.
Petersburg had been aiming at the gradual elimination of those
rural Jewish "old timers" who had been allowed under those
rules to remain in the villages.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> They had been looking for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>ward
to the time when the eyes of the Russian moujik would
no more be offended by the sight of a Jew. But this pious
wish did not materialize quickly enough. Several governors
put forth the simple proposition to expel all Jews from the
villages, not excluding those who had been settled there for a
long time. This step, however, was deemed too radical. The
Minister of Finance, Witte, wished to solve the problem in a
different way. He sought to persuade the Tzar that the introduction
of the state liquor monopoly would automatically have
the effect of forcing the Jews to leave the country-side, inasmuch
as the liquor traffic formed the principal occupation of
the village Jews.</p>

<p>Witte's conjecture was to a certain degree borne out by the
facts. By the end of the nineties the Jewish country population
of Russia had been considerably reduced. Nevertheless there
was no relief in sight. For the lust of the administration had
grown in proportion. The governors and the other gubernatorial
authorities resorted to all kinds of cunning devices to
force the Jews out of the villages or out of the railroad stations
which were situated outside the town limits. The Christian
land-owners frequently complained about these deportations,
and petitioned the governors to permit the Jewish grain merchants,
who were engaged in buying and shipping the grain
from the manorial store-houses, to reside at the railroad stations.
The Senate was compelled over and over again to pass
upon the appeals of illegally deported Jews and to enter into
an examination of all kinds of hair-splitting questions involved
in the manipulation of the anti-Jewish laws by the lower
courts, whether, for instance, an old-time Jewish villager who
returns to his home after a brief absence is to be regarded as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
a new settler who has no right to live in the country, or
whether a Jew who lives on an estate which happens to be
situated in two contiguous villages is allowed to remove from
the one to the other. As a rule the authorities decided these
questions against the Jews, though the most revolting decisions
of this kind were later reversed by the Senate.</p>

<p>In connection with the prohibition of residence outside the
cities, a new problem had arisen in Jewish life&mdash;the "summer
resort question." The authorities frequently prohibited Jewish
families from spending the summer in the outskirts of the
cities if a particular resort or cottage was found to be situated
outside the city line. Thousands of Jewish families were thus
deprived of an opportunity to rest in God's free nature during
the summer months, and to breathe the fresh air of the
fields and forests, for no other reason than that they were
Jews&mdash;a new variety of territorially affixed city serfs.</p>

<p>The law was just as merciless in the case of Jews afflicted
with disease. The watering-places situated outside the towns
were barred to Jewish sufferers who wished to take a cure there.
The Crimean watering-place Yalta, in the neighborhood of the
imperial summer resort Livadia, was the object of particular
vigilance, having been barred to the Jews by order of the dying
Alexander III.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The Jewish consumptives who had managed
to obtain "illegal" access to this spa were pitilessly expelled.
The following incident, which was reported at that time in the
Russian press, may serve as an illustration of this ruthless
policy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The wife of a [Jewish] physician had come to Yalta to improve
her shattered health. While she was suffering from severe blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>spitting,
a policeman invaded the bedroom of the sick woman,
insisting on her giving a written pledge to leave the place within
twenty-four hours. The patient was terribly frightened. On the
following day the deportation was stopped, in consequence of the
testimony of her physician that the slightest motion was fraught
with danger to the invalid. But the fright and uncertainty had
intensified the cough; the young woman became worse, and soon
afterwards died.</p></div>

<p>As it happened, the action of the police was subsequently
found to be entirely unwarranted; for, as the wife of a
physician, this victim of bureaucratic heartlessness was, even
according to the letter of the law, entitled to the right of
residence in Yalta.</p>

<p>A similar case was that of a sick Jewish student who had
been sent by his physicians to Yalta to cure his lungs. He
was expelled in the dead of winter and deported under a police
convoy, together with a batch of prisoners, to Sevastopol, notwithstanding
the fact that he was in a feverish condition.
The correspondent of a local paper in Sevastopol reported that
"along the entire road from the harbor to the prison, which
was traversed by the batch, passers-by would stop in their
walk, staggered by the extraordinary spectacle." The sufferer
appealed to the Senate, but the latter found that the orders
of the police "contained nothing contrary to the law." The
highest tribunal of the empire went with equanimity on record
that a Jewish student was liable to the penalty of being arrested
and marched under a police escort, together with criminal
offenders, for an attempt to heal his lungs in the warm
southern climate.</p>

<p>But no place in the empire could vie as regards hostility
to the Jews with the city of Kiev&mdash;this inferno of Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Israel. Though surrounded on all sides by a string of towns
and townlets with a dense Jewish population, the southwestern
metropolis was guarded by a host of police watchdogs
against the invasion of "aliens." Apart from the "privileged"
Jews who formed part of the permanent population,
the police were forced to admit into the city Jewish visitors
who came to Kiev for a few days to attend to their affairs.
Yet, haunted by the fear lest these visitors might stay there
too long, the police arranged <i>oblavas</i>, or raids, to hunt them
down like stray dogs. About once a week, during the night,
the police would raid certain hostelries in which the Jews
were wont to stop, put those that were caught under arrest,
and then expel them from the confines of the city. This
additional heavy "night work" called for a larger police staff,
and to meet this increased expenditure, an annual sum of
15,000 rubles was appropriated&mdash;from the proceeds of the Jewish
meat tax. This revenue, collected from the Jews for the
purpose of maintaining the charitable and educational institutions
of the Jewish communities, was now used to pay the
police agents to enable them to hunt down these Jews and expel
them in merciless fashion. To put it more plainly, the convict,
after being sentenced to be hanged, was forced to buy the rope.
The methods of the Russian inquisition gradually reached
the top notch of efficiency. Even the "<i>Kievlanin</i>" ("The
Kievian"), the anti-Semitic official organ of Kiev, was bound
to confess on one occasion that "in the course of the month
of July (of the year 1901) things have taken place in Kiev
which are hardly conceivable."</p>

<p>As far as the general disabilities are concerned, the entire
area of the Russian empire outside the Pale of Settlement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
though open to foreigners of all nationalities, remained hermetically
closed to the Jewish citizens of Russia, and the
borders of that prohibited area were guarded even more rigorously
than they had been during the previous reign. In the
consistent enforcement of this principle the Government did
not shrink from the most revolting extremes. A law passed
in 1896 interdicted Jewish soldiers from spending outside the
Pale of Settlement even the brief leave of absence which
they were granted during their term of military service. A
Jewish soldier serving in a regiment which was stationed, let
us say, in St. Petersburg, Moscow, or even in far-off Siberia,
was forced, under this law, to travel hundreds and even thousands
of miles to the Pale of Settlement to spend his month of
furlough there, being denied the right to remain in the city
in which he was discharging his military duty, and it made
no difference even if the furlough was granted to him for
the purpose of recuperating his health.</p>

<p>In many places of the empire, the whimsicality of the local
authorities in construing the law of residence was of a nature
to suggest that they had no other end in view except that of
making sport of the Jews. The administration of Siberia, for
instance, invented the following regulation: a Jewish merchant
or artisan who is registered in one of the Siberian
cities shall have the right only to live in the particular city of
his registration, and in no other. Since very many Jews resided
outside the localities of their accidental registration, a
transmigration of Siberian Jewry was the result. The Jews
registered, <i>e. g.</i>, in Tomsk, though they might have lived from
the day of their birth in Irkutsk, were deported in batches
to Tomsk, meeting on the way parties of exiled Jews from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Tomsk who had the misfortune of having their names entered
upon the records of Irkutsk. Human beings were shuffled like
a pack of cards. This revolting practice of the Siberian authorities,
which had begun at the end of the preceding reign,
was sustained by the Senate in a decision handed down in 1897.</p>


<h3>4. <span class="smcap">The Economic Collapse of Russian Jewry</span></h3>

<p>The result of all these persecutions was the complete economic
collapse of Russian Jewry. Speaking generally, the
economic structure of the Russian Jews experienced violent
upheavals during the first years of Nicholas II.'s reign. The
range of Jewish economic endeavor, circumscribed though it
was, was narrowed more and more. In 1894, the law placing
the liquor trade under Government control was put into effect
by Witte, the Minister of Finance. Catering to the prejudices
of the ruling spheres of Russia, Witte had already endeavored
to convince Alexander III. that the liquor state monopoly
would have the effect of completely undermining "Jewish exploitation,"
the latter being primarily bound up with the sale
of liquor in the towns and villages. In view of this, the
monopoly was introduced with particular zeal in the western
governments, where a little later, in the course of 1896-1898,
during the reign of Nicholas II., all private pot-houses were
replaced by official liquor stores, the so-called "imperial bar-rooms."
In consequence of this reform, tens of thousands of
Jewish families who had derived their livelihood either directly
from the liquor trade, or indirectly from occupations connected
with it, such as the keeping of inns and hostelries, were
deprived of their means of subsistence. It goes without saying
that, as far as the moral aspect of the problem was concerned,
the best elements of Russian Jewry welcomed this reform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
which bade fair to wipe out an ugly stain on the escutcheon
of the Jewish people&mdash;the liquor traffic bequeathed to the Jews
by ancient Poland. Known as the most sober people on earth,
the Jews had been placed in the tragic position that thousands
of them, in their search for a piece of bread, were forced
to serve as a medium for promoting the pernicious Russian
drunkenness. The memory of the days when the Jewish
saloon was the breeding-place of pogroms, in which the Russian
peasants and burghers filled themselves with Jewish
alcohol to fortify themselves in their infamous work of demolishing
the homes of the Jews, was still fresh in their minds.
Cheerfully would the Jewish people have yielded its monopoly
of the liquor trade to the Russian bar-room keepers and
to the Russian Government who seemed genuinely attracted
toward it, had it only been allowed to pursue other methods
of earning a livelihood. But in closing the avenue of the
liquor traffic to two hundred thousand Jews, the Government
did not even think of removing the special restrictions which
barred their way to other lines of endeavor. Having been
robbed of the scanty livelihood they derived from their country
inns, thousands of rural victims of the state monopoly flocked
into the cities, only to clash with a host of urban victims of
the same reform who had also been deprived of their means of
sustenance. The growth of the proletariat within the Pale
of Settlement, both in business and in the trades, assumed
appalling proportions. The observers of economic life in the
Pale, such as the well-known Russian economist Subbotin and
others, called attention to the frightful increase of pauperism
in that region. Between 1894 and 1898 the number of Jewish
families in need of assistance increased twenty-seven per cent.
as compared with former years. In 1897, the number of Jews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
without definite occupations amounted in certain cities to fifty
per cent. and more. The number of destitute Jews applying
for help before the Passover festival reached unheard of proportions,
amounting in Odessa, Vilna, Minsk, Kovno, and
other cities to forty and even fifty per cent. of the total Jewish
population. The crop failures of 1899 and 1900 in the
south of Russia resulted in a terrible famine among the impecunious
Jewish masses. Whereas the peasants who suffered
from the same calamity received financial assistance
from the Government, the Jews had to resort to self-help,
to the collection of funds throughout the empire to which only
here and there liberal Christians added their mites.</p>

<p>Many of these Jewish proletarians were willing to take up
agriculture, but the "Temporary Rules" of 1882 blocked their
way to the country-side, and made it impossible for them to buy
or even lease a piece of land. Prominent Jews of St. Petersburg,
such as Baron G&uuml;nzburg and others, petitioned the
Government to allow the Jews to purchase small parcels of
land for personal use, but, after long deliberations, their petition
was rejected. Thus, at the end of the nineteenth century,
the ruling spheres of the Russian empire proved more anti-Semitic
than at the beginning of the same century, when the
Government of Alexander I. and even that of Nicholas I. had
endeavored to promote agriculture among the Jews and had
established the Jewish agricultural colonies in the south of
Russia.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The mania of oppression went so far as to prohibit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the Jews from buying or leasing parcels of land which were
part of a city, but happened to be situated outside the city
line. A rich Jew of Minsk, by the name of Pollak, petitioned,
in 1897, the local Town Council to sell him a piece of suburban
property for the establishment of a Jewish agricultural farm,
but his petition was refused. This refusal was thoroughly
consistent. For the fact that the Jews were forbidden to own
land made the training of Jews in the art of agriculture
entirely superfluous. It may be added that this prohibition of
land ownership was upheld by the Government even in the case
of the Jewish students who had completed their course in
the school of the Jewish Agricultural Farm near Odessa.</p>

<p>Similar methods were employed to check the development
of arts and crafts, which were widely represented among the
Jews, but stood on a very low technical level. Even the efforts
to organize mutual help among the working classes were
blocked by the Government in all kinds of ways. The well-known
Jewish millionaire, Brodski, of Kiev, wishing to assist
the toiling masses without distinction of creed, offered to open
a trade bank in that city and to contribute towards that purpose
the sum of 120,000 rubles. When, in 1895, he submitted
the constitution of the proposed bank to the local authorities
for their approval, he was required to insert a clause to the
effect that the directors and the chairman of the bank council
should always be Christians and that the council itself should
not include more than one Jewish member. To this insolent
demand Brodski made the only fitting retort: "Being
myself a Jew, I cannot possibly agree that the constitution
of an establishment which is to be founded with the money
contributed by me and which is to bear my name shall contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
restrictions affecting my coreligionists." He naturally withdrew
his offer, and Kiev was deprived of a trade bank. The
fact that the failure of the project also affected the Christian
artisans did not disturb the authorities in the least. It was
enough of a compensation that the Jews were made to suffer
not only materially, but also morally, and the purpose of the
highly-placed Jew-baiters was accomplished.</p>


<h3>5. <span class="smcap">Professional and Educational Restrictions</span></h3>

<p>In the domain of those liberal professions to which the
Jewish intellectuals, being barred from entering the civil service,
were particularly attracted, the law went to almost any
length in its endeavor to keep them closed to the Jews. The
legal career had been blocked to them ever since the passage of
the law of 1889, which made the admission of a properly
qualified Jew to the bar dependent upon the granting of a
special permission by the Minister of Justice. In the course
of a whole decade, the Minister found it possible to grant this
permission only to one Jew, who, it may be added, had
sat on the bench for twenty-five years&mdash;there were two or
three such "relics," dating back to the liberal era of Alexander II.
In consequence of this provision, the proportion
of Jews at the bar, which prior to the enactment of the restriction
had reached from fourteen to twenty-two per cent, was
reduced to nine per cent. In 1897, a committee appointed by
the Government was considering the proposal to place the disability
on the statute books and to establish a ten per cent norm
for Jewish lawyers. The reasons advanced by the committee
for the proposed restriction were of the distinctly medi&aelig;val
variety:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The conduct of a lawyer is determined by the impulses of his
will, of his conscience,&mdash;in other words, that sphere of his inner
life which finds its manifestation in religion. Now the admission
of Jews constitutes a menace, resulting from views peculiar to
the Jewish race, which are contrary to Christian morality.</p></div>

<p>Subsequently, the champions of "Christian morality" on
the staff of the Ministry of Justice bethought themselves that
it might even be better and nobler to stop the admission
of Jews to the bar altogether, and the proposal regarding the
percentage norm was tabled. Hundreds upon hundreds of
young Jews who had completed their legal education at the
universities, or who had acted as assistants to sworn attorneys,
saw once more their hopes for the legitimate pursuit of their
profession vanish into the air.</p>

<p>Jewish physicians were restricted to private practice and
robbed of their right to occupy a Government or public position.
Even the autonomous Zemstvo institutions adopted
more and more the practice of refusing to appoint Jews, and
very frequently the printed advertisements of the Zemstvos
offering medical positions contained the stipulation <i>kromye
yevreyev</i> ("except the Jews").</p>

<p>The scholastic education of the Jewish children was throttled
in the same pitiless manner as theretofore. The disgraceful
school norm which had been introduced in 1887<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> performed
with ever-increasing relentlessness its task of dooming to spiritual
death the Jewish youths who were knocking at the doors of
the gymnazia and universities. In the beginning of 1898,
the post of Minister of Public Instruction, which had been
occupied by Dyelanov, was entrusted to Professor Bogolepov
of Moscow. While Dyelanov had been occasionally inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
to soften the rigor of the school norm&mdash;it was commonly
rumored that this good-natured dignitary could not bear to
see a woman cry, and the tearful entreaties of the mothers of
the rejected scholars made him sanction the admission of a
certain number of Jewish children over and above the established
percentage norm&mdash;his successor Bogolepov, an academic
teacher who had become a gendarme of education, was impervious
to any sentiment of pity. In the course of the three years
of his administration, he not only refused to admit the slightest
departure from the established norm, but attempted to curtail
it still further. Thus, orders were issued to calculate the
percentage norm of the Jewish applicants for admission to the
universities not in its relation to the total number of the annual
admissions, but separately for each faculty (1898-1899).
This provision was designed to limit the number of Jewish
students who flocked to the medical and legal faculties, since,
in view of the fact that the Jews were entirely barred from
appointments in the general educational institutions, the other
faculties did not offer them even a sporting chance of
earning a livelihood. The ruthlessness displayed by the Ministry
of Public Instruction towards the Jewish youth was
officially justified on the ground that certain elements among
them were affiliated with the revolutionary movement which,
just at that time, had assumed particular intensity in the Russian
student body. This sentiment was openly voiced in a
circular of the Ministry, issued on May 26, 1901, which makes
the following statement: "The disorders which took place at
the end of the nineties in the institutions of higher learning
testified to the fact that the instigators of these disorders were,
to a large extent, persons of non-Russian extraction."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Bogolepov himself, the reactionary Minister of enlightenment,
fell a victim of this agitation among the student body.
He died from the bullet of a Terrorist who happened to be of
unadulterated Russian extraction. His successor, General Vannovski
(1901-1902), though endeavoring to assuage the university
disorders by a policy of "kindly solicitude," maintained
the former uncompromising attitude as far as the Jews
were concerned. In view of the fact that, in spite of all
restrictions, the ratio of Jewish students at all universities
actually exceeded the norm prescribed by law, the new Minister
decreed that the percentage of Jewish admissions be temporarily
curtailed in the following proportion: Two per cent for
the capitals (instead of the former three per cent), three per
cent for the universities outside of the Pale of Settlement (instead
of five per cent), and seven per cent for the Pale of
Settlement (instead of ten per cent).</p>

<p>Even the restrictions placed upon the admission of the Jews
to the gymnazia were intensified. In 1901, Jewish children
who had graduated from a pro-gymnazium<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> were forbidden to
continue their education in the advanced classes of a gymnazium
unless there was a free Jewish vacancy within the
percentage norm&mdash;a truly miraculous contingency. The same
policy was extended to the commercial schools established with
funds which were provided by the merchant class and the bulk
of which came from Jews. In the commercial schools maintained
by the commercial associations Jewish children were admitted
only in proportion to the contributions of the Jewish
merchants towards the upkeep of the particular school. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
private commercial schools, however, percentages of all kinds,
varying from ten to fifty per cent, were fixed in the case of
Jewish pupils. This provision had the effect that Jewish
parents were vitally interested in securing the entrance of as
many Christian children as possible in order to increase thereby
the number of Jewish vacancies. Occasionally, a Jewish
father, in the hope of creating a vacancy for his son, would induce
a Christian to send his boy to a commercial school&mdash;though
the latter, as a rule, offered little attraction for the
Christian population&mdash;by undertaking to defray all expenses
connected with his education. Yet many Jewish children,
though enduring all these humiliations, found themselves outside
the doors of the intermediate Russian schools.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that in this attempt at the spiritual extermination
of the Jewish children by barring them from
intermediate educational institutions the Russian law followed
strictly the ancient rule of the Pharaohs: "If it be a son,
then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall
live." The Government schools for girls were opened to the
Jewish population without any restriction, and the influx of
Jewesses to these gymnazia was only checked unofficially
by the anti-Semitic authorities of this or that institution,
thereby turning the tide of applicants in the direction of private
girls' schools. But as far as the higher schools were
concerned, Jewish girls were subjected to the same restrictions
as the boys. The Higher Courses for Women and the
Pedagogic Courses in St. Petersburg restricted the admission
of Jewesses to five per cent. The constitution of the Medical
Institute for Women, founded in 1895, provided at first for
the entire exclusion of Jewesses. But in 1897, the doors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
this institution were opened to the hated tribe&mdash;just enough
to admit them to the extent of three per cent.</p>

<p>It was scarcely to be expected that the Jewish youths who
had been locked out of the Russian school should entertain
particularly friendly sentiments towards a r&eacute;gime which
wasted their lives, humiliated their dignity, and sullied their
souls. The Jewish lad, driven from the doors of the gymnazia,
became an embittered "extern," who was forced to study at
home and from year to year present himself for examination
before the school authorities. An immense host of young
men and women who found their way blocked to the higher
educational institutions in Russia went abroad, flocking to
foreign universities and higher professional schools, where they
learned to estimate at its full value a r&eacute;gime which in their own
country denied them the advantages granted to them outside
of it. A large number of these college youths returned home
permeated with revolutionary ideas&mdash;living witnesses to the
sagacity of a Government which saw its reason for existence in
the suppression of all revolutionary strivings.</p>


<h3>6. <span class="smcap">Anti-Semitic Propaganda and Pogroms</span></h3>

<p>The reactionary Russian press, encouraged and stimulated
by the official Jew-baiters, engaged in an increasingly ferocious
campaign against the Jews. The Russian censorship, known
all over for its merciless cruelty, which was throttling the
printed word and trembling at the criminal thought of "inciting
hatred toward the Government," yet granted untrammeled
freedom to those who propagated hatred to Judaism, and
thereby committed the equally criminal offence of "inciting
one part of the population against the other." The <i>Novoye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Vremya</i>, the most wide-spread semi-official press organ, and its
satellites in the provincial capitals were permitted to do what
they pleased. They were free to slander the Jewish religion,
the Jewish people, and the Jewish communities. When the
famous Dreyfus affair had started in France, the <i>Novoye
Vremya</i>, the oracle of Russia's ruling spheres, arrayed itself
on the side of the Jew-baiters from among the French general
staff, and launched a savage campaign of slander against the
Jews of the entire globe. Many an article published in the
anti-Semitic press was scarcely distinguishable from the proclamations
calling upon the mob to massacre the Jews.</p>

<p>By far the most effective propaganda on behalf of pogroms
was carried on, sometimes without a conscious realization of the
consequences, by the Government itself: by persisting in its
anti-Jewish policy. Observing this uninterrupted maltreatment
of the Jews on the part of the Russian legislation and
administration, which treated the Jews as if they were criminals,
witnessing the expulsions inflicted upon the "illegally
residing" Jews and the raids engineered against them,
watching the constant mockery at the Jewish children who
were driven from the doors of the educational institutions,
and seeing the endless multitude of other humiliating disabilities,
the unenlightened Russian populace necessarily
gained the conviction that the extermination of Jewry was a
noble and patriotic duty. Coupled with the usual economic
and national conflicts, this trend of mind could not but lead to
acts of violence.</p>

<p>At the end of the nineties the Russian horizon was darkened
again by the ominous shadow of the beginning of the eighties:
pogroms, at first sporadic and within circumscribed limits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
broke out again in various parts of the Pale. On February
18 and 19, 1897, an anti-Jewish riot took place in Shpola, a
town in the government of Kiev. The following officially
inspired account of the excesses, in which the facts were undoubtedly
toned down, appeared in the <i>Novoye Vremya</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At three o'clock in the afternoon an immense crowd of peasants
rushed into our town, and wrecked completely the stores, homes, and
warehouses belonging exclusively to the Jews. A large number of
rich business places and small stores, as well as hundreds of houses,
were demolished by the crowd, which acted, one might say, with
elemental passion, dooming to destruction everything that fell into
its hands. The town of Shpola, which is celebrated for its
flourishing trade and its comparative prosperity, now presents the
picture of a city which has been ravaged by a hostile army. Lines
of old women and children may be seen moving [into the town]
to carry home with them the property of the "Zhyds." Of essential
importance is the fact that these disorders were undoubtedly
prearranged. The local Jews knew of the impending disaster
four days before it took place; they spoke about it to the local
police chief, but the latter assured them that "nothing is going to
happen."</p></div>

<p>Two months later, on April 16 and 17, the Christian inhabitants
of the town of Kantakuzenka, in the government of
Kherson, indulged in a similar "amusement" at the expense
of the Jews. To quote the words of a semi-official report:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A cruel pogrom has taken place. Almost the entire town has
been destroyed by an infuriated mob. All Jewish stores were
wrecked and the goods found there were thrown about. A part of
the merchandise was looted by the rabble. The synagogue alone
remained unscathed.</p></div>

<p>Here, too, it was known beforehand that a pogrom was in the
course of preparation. The Jews petitioned the authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
to avert the catastrophe, but the local police force was found
inadequate to cope with the situation.</p>

<p>In both devastated towns the governors of the respective
provinces eventually appeared on the scene with detachments
of troops, but in the meantime the revolting performances were
over. Many rioters were placed under arrest and put on trial.
More than sixty were sentenced by the courts to a term in
prison from eight to fourteen months. One of the defendants,
a Little-Russian peasant, who had been arrested for having
taken part in an anti-Jewish riot, voiced his amazement in these
characteristic words: "They told us we had permission to
beat the Jews, and now it appears that it is all a lie."</p>

<p>A pogrom on a more comprehensive scale, arranged in honor
of the Easter festival, and lasting for three days (April
19-21, 1899), was allowed to take place in the city of Nicholayev,
the South-Russian port of entry. Bands of rioters, to the
number of several thousand, among them many newly arrived
Great-Russian day laborers, and a few "intellectual" ringleaders,
fell upon Jewish stores and residences and destroyed
or looted their contents, complying faithfully with the established
pogrom ritual, while the police and Cossack forces
proved "powerless." On the third day, when the news of the
freedom accorded to the rioters and robbers at Nicholayev
reached the villages in the vicinity, a whole army of peasants,
both men and women, numbering some ten thousand, started
towards the city on their wagons, with the intention of carrying
off the property of the Jews&mdash;but they were too late; for
in the meantime Cossacks and soldiers had been ordered to
stop the pogroms and disperse the rioters. The peasants
were driven off and had to return to their villages on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
empty wagons. Exasperated by their failure, the peasants
vented their fury upon the Jewish cemetery outside the city,
demolishing a large number of tombstones, and then, scattering
all over the district, made an attack upon the Jewish
population in the neighboring settlements and villages. In
the Jewish agricultural colony of Nagartava all farm-houses
and stores were wrecked and looted, and the agricultural implements
demolished. The Russian peasant was unscrupulously
ruining and robbing his Jewish fellow-peasant. In the adjacent
colonies, the Jews, being of a robust physique, were
able to put up an effective defence.</p>

<p>The only protest against this new outbreak of barbarism was
voiced by the "Son of the Fatherland" (<i>Syn Otyechestva</i>),
a liberal Russian press organ:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When at last&mdash;questioned the paper&mdash;will that terrible relic of
the gloomy era of the Middle Ages take an end? When will there
be a stop to this breaking of windows, this beating of men and
this wrecking of houses and stores?</p></div>

<p>This time the orders from St. Petersburg were explicit: the
local authorities were commanded to prevent the further spread
of the pogrom agitation. The reason for this unaccustomed
attitude is not difficult to guess. Two weeks after the Nicholayev
atrocities, the first International Hague Conference
opened its sessions (May 6-18), having been called at the initiative
of the Russian emperor to discuss the question of disarmament,
and this Conference must have suggested to the Tzar
the advisability of first disarming the anti-Jewish rioters in
Russia itself. However, he failed to draw the more important
conclusion from the Conference called by him: that it was
necessary to stop, or at least to reduce, the constant arming of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
his own Government against the Jews and to discard the
medi&aelig;val weapons of oppression and persecution which spelled
destruction to an entire nation. This alone is enough to expose
the hollowness of the spectacle at the Hague, which had been
designed by the feeble-minded Nicholas as a sort of diplomatic
entertainment.</p>

<p>That the Russian authorities, when so minded, were fully
capable of grappling with the pogrom agitation was demonstrated
by the rapidity with which, on a later occasion, they
suppressed the anti-Jewish excesses in the Polish city of
Chenstokhov (August 19, 1902). In this hotbed of dismal
Polish clericalism, the goal of thousands of Catholic pilgrims,
who arrive there to worship the Holy Virgin on the "Bright
Mountain," a street brawl between a Jewish tradesman and a
Polish woman grew, owing to the instigations of Catholic
priests, into a monstrous assault upon Jewish houses and stores
by a crowd of fifteen thousand Poles. Here, too, the customary
shouts were heard: "Beat the Jews! Nothing will
happen to us." But the Chenstokhov rioters made a grievous
error in their calculation. The protection of the Russian authorities
did not extend to the Poles who were not considered
politically "dependable," and were known to be equally hostile
to the Zhyds and the "Moskals."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The excesses had started
in the morning, and in the evening they were at an end, a
volley from the soldiers having put the tremendous crowd to
flight. When the case came up before the courts, the public
prosecutor pleaded for the severe punishment of the culprits.
The guilty Poles were sentenced to penal servitude and to terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
in prison, and in some cases even damages were awarded to the
Jewish victims&mdash;an extraordinarily rare occurrence in legal
proceedings of this kind.</p>

<p>The union of Polish anti-Semitism with Russian Jud&aelig;ophobia
brought again to life the old monstrous accusation
against the Jews&mdash;the ritual murder libel. A Polish servant
girl in the employ of David Blondes, a Jewish barber in Vilna,
steeped, as she was, in gross superstition and being a pliant
tool in the hands of fanatical priests, ran out one night
(March, 1900) into the street, shouting that her master had
wounded her and had tried to squeeze blood from her for the
Matzah. A crowd of Christians quickly assembled, and seeing
the scratches on the neck and hands of the girl, fell upon
Blondes and gave him a severe beating. The "criminal" was
thrown into prison, and the prosecuting authorities, listening
to the "voice of the people," were zealous in their search for
the threads of the crime. The anti-Semitic press launched a
well-planned campaign against the Jews in the hope of influencing
the judicial verdict. The lower court recognized
the fact of the assault, but denied the presence of any murderous
intent, and, leaving aside the possibility of a ritual
motive, sentenced Blondes to imprisonment for four months.
The counsel for the defence, the well-known lawyer Gruzenberg,
and others, fearing lest this sentence might be construed
by the enemies of Judaism as a corroboration of the
ritual murder libel, appealed from the verdict of the court,
and proved victorious: a decision handed down by the Senate
ordered the case to be sent back for a second trial to the District
Court of Vilna, and the court of jurymen, after listening
to the statements of authoritative experts and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
brilliant speeches of the defence, rendered a verdict of not
guilty (February 1, 1902). The prisoner was set at liberty,
and the nightmare of the "ritual murder Dreyfusiad" was
dispelled for the time being.</p>

<p>Even the Russian stage was made subservient to the purposes
of Jew-baiting. A converted Jew by the name of Efron-Litvin,
who had joined the anti-Semitic business firm of the
<i>Novoye Vremya</i>, wrote a libelous play under the title "The
Sons of Israel," or "The Smugglers," in which Jews and
Judaism were made the subject of the most horrible calumnies.
The play was first produced at St. Petersburg, in the theatre
controlled by Suvorin, the publisher of the <i>Novoye Vremya</i>,
and in the course of 1901-1902 it made the rounds of the
provincial stage. Everywhere, the Russian Jew-haters welcomed
this talentless production, which pictured the Jews
as rogues and criminals, and represented the Jewish religion
and morality as the fountain-head whence the supposed hatred
of the Jews against the Christians derived its origin. Naturally
enough the Jews and the best elements among the Russian
<i>intelligenzia</i> looked upon the mere staging of such a play as
an incitement to pogroms. They appealed repeatedly to the
police, calling upon them to stop the production of a play which
was sure to fan national and religious hatred. The police,
however, were not guided by the wishes of the Jews, but by
those of their enemies. As a result, in a considerable number
of cities where the play was presented, such as Smolensk,
Oryol, Kishinev, Tiflis, and others, violent demonstrations
took place in the theatres. The Jewish spectators and a
part of the Russian public, particularly from among the college
youth, hissed and hooted, demanding the removal from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
stage of this libel on a whole people. The anti-Semites, in
turn, shouted: "Down with the Jews!", and started a fight
with the demonstrators. The police, of course, sided with the
anti-Semites, attacking the demonstrators and dragging them
to the police stations. This agitation led to a number of legal
proceedings against the Jews who were charged with disturbing
the peace. During the trial of one of these cases (in the
city of Oryol), the counsel for the defence used the following
argument:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The play inflames the national passions, and makes the national
traits of a people the object of ridicule and mockery,&mdash;of a people,
moreover, which is denied equal rights and has no means of voicing
its protest. The production of such a play should never have been
permitted, the more so as the police were well acquainted with the
agitated state of the public mind.</p></div>

<p>The argument of the defending attorney was scarcely convincing.
For the article of the Russian law which forbids the
"incitement of one part of the population against the other"
loses its validity when the "other part" means the Jews.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII</a><br />

THE NATIONAL AWAKENING</h2>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">The Rise of Political Zionism</span></h3>

<p>For two decades the sledge hammer of Russian reaction had
been descending with crushing force upon the vast community
of the six million Russian Jews. Yet in the end it was
found that the heavy hammer, to use the well-known simile
of Pushkin, instead of shattering the national organism of
Jewry, had only helped to steel it and to harden its indestructible
spiritual self. The Jewry of Russia showed to the world
that it was endowed with an iron constitution, and those that
had hoped to crush it by the strokes of their hammer were ultimately
forced to admit that they had produced the opposite
result. At first it seemed as if the effect of these blows would
be to turn Jewry into a shapeless mass. There were moments
of despair and complete prostration, when the approaching
darkness threatened to obliterate all paths. This stage was followed
by a period of mental haziness, marked by dim yearnings
for regeneration, which were bound to remain fruitless because
unaccompanied by organizing energy.</p>

<p>This transitional state of affairs lasted throughout the
eighties and during the first half of the nineties. But by and
by, out of the chaos of these nebulous social tendencies, there
emerged more and more clearly the outlines of definite politico-national
doctrines and organizations, and new paths were
blazed which, leading in different directions, converged toward
one goal&mdash;that of the regeneration of the Jewish people from
within, both in its national and social life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>The turning-point of this process is marked by the year
1897. That year, in which the first International Zionist
Congress held its sessions, inaugurated not only the political
Zionist movement, but also the development of other currents
of Jewish national and political thought. The entire gamut of
public slogans rang through the air, all bearing testimony to
one and the same fact: that the era of national prostration had
come to an end, and that the vague longings for liberation and
regeneration had assumed the character of a conscious endeavor
pursuing a well-defined course. The careful observer could
scarcely fail to perceive that beneath the hammer of history
the formless mass of Jewry was being forged into a well-shaped
instrument of great power. The organization of the Jewish
people had made its beginning.</p>

<p>Among the movements which arose at the end of the nineteenth
century there were some which came to the surface of
Jewish life rather noisily, attracting the attention of the Jewish
masses as well as that of the outside world. Others, however,
were imbedded more deeply in the consciousness of the educated
classes and were productive of a new outlook upon the national
Jewish problem. The former were an answer to the question
of the "Jewish misery," of the <i>Judennot</i>, in its practical aspect.
The latter offered a solution of the national-cultural problem
of Judaism in its totality. The movements of the first kind
are represented by Political Zionism and Territorialism. In
the second category stand Spiritual Zionism and National-Cultural
Autonomism. On a parallel line with both varieties
of the national movement, and frequently intersecting it, went
the Jewish socialistic movement, tinged to a lesser or larger
degree by nationalistic tendencies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>For fifteen years, the "Lovers of Zion," or the <i>Hibbat Zion</i>
movement, had been pursuing its course in Russia, without
showing marked progress in the direction of that universal
Jewish goal which had been formulated by its champions,
Lilienblum and Pinsker.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> During that period some fifteen
Jewish agricultural colonies had sprung up in Palestine. The
Jewish population of the Holy Land had been increased by
some twenty thousand souls, and an effort had been made to
create a national model school and to revive the ancient Hebrew
tongue; but needless to say all this was far from solving the
burning question of the six million Russian Jews who were
clamoring for relief from their intolerable condition. At the
slow rate of progress which had hitherto characterized the
Jewish endeavors in Palestine any attempt to transfer a considerable
portion of the Russian center to the Holy Land was
doomed to failure, particularly in view of the hostility of the
Turkish Government which was anxious to check even this
insignificant growth of Jewish colonization.</p>

<p>At that juncture, the air of Europe resounded with the
clarion tones of Theodor Herzl's appeal to the Jews to establish
a "Jewish State." The appeal came from Western Europe,
from the circles in which the sufferings of their "Eastern
brethren" had hitherto been viewed entirely from the philanthropic
point of view. It came from a young Viennese journalist
who had been aroused by the orgy of anti-Semitism in the
capital of Austria (the agitation of Burgomaster Lueger, and
others), and by the exciting anti-Jewish scenes enacted in the
capital of France, where, as a correspondent of the Viennese
daily "<i>Die Neu Freie Presse</i>," he followed the Dreyfus affair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
in its first early stages. Herzl became suddenly conscious of
the acute pain of the Jewish misery. He saw the anti-Semitism
of Western Europe closing ranks with the Jud&aelig;ophobia of
Eastern Europe. He saw the ideal of assimilation crumbling
to pieces, and he made up his mind to hoist the flag of Jewish
nationalism, scarcely aware of the fact that it had already been
hoisted in the East.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> His pamphlet ("The Jewish State"),
which appeared in the beginning of 1896, was in its fundamental
premises a repetition of the old appeal of Pinsker. The
author of the new publication was convinced, like his predecessor,
that the only relief from the Jewish misery lay in the concentration
of the Jewish people upon a separate territory,
without determining the question whether that territory should
be Palestine or Argentina. But, in contradistinction to Pinsker,
Herzl was not satisfied with formulating the problem theoretically;
he offered at the same time a plan of political and
economic organization by means of which the problem was to
be solved: the creation of special representative bodies which
were to enter into negotiations with rulers and Governments
concerning the cession of an appropriate territory to the Jews
under an international protectorate, and were also to obtain
huge funds to carry out the transplantation and resettlement
of vast Jewish masses. Representing a combination of theoretic
enthusiasm and practical Utopias, the "Jewish State" of
Herzl revived the nearly smothered political hopes which had
been cherished by the <i>Hobebe Zion</i> circles in Russia. The Russian
Jews, groaning under the yoke of an Egyptian bondage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
flocked to the new Moses who announced the glad tidings of the
Exodus, and Herzl, beholding the ready hosts in the shape of
the <i>Hobebe Zion</i> societies, was quick to adjust his territorialistic
scheme to the existing Palestinian movement.</p>

<p>In this wise, the organization of political Zionism sprang into
life, using as its medium of expression the international party
congresses, most of which convened in Switzerland, in the
city of Basle. The first Basle Congress held in August, 1897,
was an impressive demonstration of the national awakening of
the Jewish people. For the first time, the united representatives
of Eastern and Western Jewry proclaimed before the world
that the scattered sections of Jewry looked upon themselves
as one national organism striving for national regeneration.
From the center of Western assimilation, advocating the disappearance
of Jewry, came the war-cry, proclaiming the continued
existence of the Jewish nation, though that existence
was conditioned by the establishment of a separate "publicly
and legally assured" territorial center. Of the four articles
of the "Basle program," which were adopted by the first
Congress, three deal with the fundamental task of the party,
the political and financial endeavors looking to the colonization
of large Jewish masses in Palestine, and only one voices
the need "of strengthening the Jewish national feeling and
self-respect."</p>

<p>In the further progress of the Zionist organization, these
two principles, the political and the cultural, were constantly
struggling for mastery, the Zionists of the West gravitating
toward political activities and diplomatic negotiations, while
the Zionists of the East laid greater emphasis upon internal
cultural work along national lines, looking upon it as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
indispensable prerequisite for national rebirth. The struggle
between these two principles continued at each succeeding
annual Congress (at the second and third held in Basle in 1898
and 1899, at the fourth in London in 1900, and at the fifth
in Basle in 1901). On the one hand, the Zionists were
feverishly engaged in the external organization of the movement:
the consolidation of the Shekel-payer societies, the
creation of the Jewish Colonial Trust and the Jewish National
Fund, the conduct of diplomatic negotiations with the Turkish
Government and with the political representatives of other
countries for the purpose of obtaining a guaranteed "charter"
for a wholesale colonization in Palestine. On the other hand,
endeavors were made to nationalize the Jewish intellectual
classes, to promote the Hebrew language, to create a national
school, and "to conquer the communities" for Zionism, that
is, to strengthen the influence of the party in the administration
of the Jewish communities. The Convention of Russian
Zionists, held at Minsk in 1902, paid particular attention to
the cultural aspirations of the party, and adopted a resolution
calling for the appointment of two committees, an orthodox
and a progressive, to find ways and means for placing
Jewish education on a national basis. The same Convention
demonstrated the growth of the movement, for, during the
first five years of its existence, the Zionist organization in
Russia had succeeded in securing about seventy thousand
Shekel-payers who were organized in approximately five hundred
societies.</p>

<p>Yet the political and financial achievements of Zionism during
that period of bloom&mdash;prior to the crisis of 1903&mdash;were
insignificant. The diplomatic negotiations of the Zionist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
leader, Dr. Theodor Herzl, with the Sultan of Turkey and his
Government, as well as with the German emperor and several
other European sovereigns, failed of their purpose&mdash;the obtaining
of a Turkish charter for the wholesale colonization of Palestine.
The financial instrument of the party, the Jewish
Colonial Trust, proved as yet too weak to collect the proposed
fund of ten million dollars&mdash;a modest sum when compared
with the purpose for which it was destined. The colonization
of Palestine proceeded at a slow pace, and its miniature scale
was entirely out of proportion to the grand plan of establishing
a national autonomous center in Palestine. Withal, Zionism
proved during that brief interval a potent factor in the national
awakening of Jewry. The strength of the movement
lay, not in the political aims of the organization, which
were mostly beyond reach, but in the very fact that tens of
thousands of Jews were organized with a national end in
view. It lay, moreover, in the current national-cultural activities,
in the <i>Gegenwartsarbeit</i>, which, yielding to necessity, had
been raised from a means to an end. In Western Europe, the
principal significance of Zionism lay in its effect as a counterbalance
to assimilation, Herzl having declared that "Zionism
aims at the establishment of a publicly and legally assured
home for those Jews who, in their present places of residence,
are not able, or not willing, to assimilate themselves." In Russia,
however, where Jewish life was dominated by more powerful
nationalizing influences, the chief importance of political
Zionism lay in this very propaganda of a national rebirth in the
midst of those whom militant Jud&aelig;ophobia was endeavoring
to reduce by intolerable oppression to the level of moral degenerates.
The apathy and faint-heartedness which had charac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>terized
public Jewish life during the eighties and the first half
of the nineties was followed by a period of noisy bustle, of
organizing activity, and of great animation. The Pale of
Settlement resounded with the din of its hundreds of Zionist
societies, with the speeches of Zionist agitators at public meetings
and in the synagogues, with the intense agitation preceding
the elections for each Zionist congress, with the heated debates
about the program between the political and the cultural Zionists,
between the Mizrahists (the faction of orthodox Zionists)
and the Progressives. The public utterances of the Zionist
leaders, Herzl and Nordau, were the subject of interminable
discussion and comment. The Russian Jews were particularly
stirred by the annual Congress addresses of Nordau on the
"General Situation in Jewry," in which the famous writer
pictured with characteristic vividness the tragedy of the <i>Golus</i>,
the boundless extent of Jewish misery, having a material aspect
in the lands of oppression and a moral aspect among the emancipated
sections of Jewry, and which culminated in the thought
that Jewry could not exist without Zion.</p>

<p>Nordau's motto, "Jewry will be Zionistic, or it will not be,"
was differently interpreted in the different circles of the Russian
Jewish <i>intelligenzia</i>. Among the Russian leaders of the
party only a minority (Dr. Mandelstamm of Kiev, and others)
were fully in accord with the extreme political views of the
Western leaders. The majority of the former workers in the
ranks of the <i>Hobebe Zion</i> movement (Ussishkin, Chlenov, and
others) sought to harmonize the political functions of Zionism
with its cultural aspirations and combine the diplomatic negotiations
concerning a charter with the upkeep of the existing
colonization work in Palestine, which latter was contemptuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
branded by the hide-bound adherents of political Zionism as
"infiltration." This Babel of opinions within the ranks of the
organization could not fail to weaken its effectiveness as an
agency for the attainment of the ultimate Zionist goal. At the
same time, it brought life and animation into the movement.
The crack of the whip of the Egyptian taskmasters remained
unheard amidst the clash of ideas and the proud slogans of
national liberation which resounded throughout the Jewish
Pale.</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">Spiritual Zionism, or Ahad-Ha&acute;amism</span></h3>

<p>And yet, political Zionism viewed as a theory failed to offer
a satisfactory solution of the great Jewish problem in all its
historic complexity. Born of the reaction against anti-Semitism,
and endeavoring to soothe the pain of the wounded Jewish
heart, it was marked by all the merits and demerits of a theory
which was substantially Messianic in character and was entirely
dependent on subjective forces, on faith and will-power. "If
you only will it, then it is no fairy tale"<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>&mdash;in these words the
ultimate goal of political Zionism is indicated by its founder,
who firmly believed that an extraordinary exertion of the
national will would transform the fairy tale of a "Jewish
state" into reality. When confronted with the question as to
the future of the Jewish nation in case faith and will-power
should prove unable to grapple with the conditions over which it
had no control, and the "fairy tale" of a united political autonomous
center should not be realized, political Zionism either
remained silent or indulged in a polemical retort which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
in flagrant contradiction to Jewish history: "Without Zion,
Judaism is bound to perish." The national conscience, however,
could not be reconciled to such an answer. A more or
less satisfactory solution of the problem of Judaism could
not spring from the external reaction against anti-Semitism,
but could only mature as the fruit of profound contemplation
of the course of development pursued by the Jewish people
in the Diaspora; such a solution could only be found in the
endeavor to adapt the new national movement to this historic
course. From this point of view political Zionism was rectified
by "Spiritual Zionism," the teaching of the publicist and
philosopher Ahad Ha'am (U. Ginzberg).</p>

<p>Even before political Zionism, or "Herzlianism," appeared
on the scene, Ahad Ha'am had succeeded in substantially modifying
the Palestinian idea as formulated by Lilienblum and
Pinsker. In the program of the semi-Masonic order <i>Bne
Moshe</i> ("Sons of Moses"), established by him in Odessa,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> he
laid down the fundamental principle that the preparation of
the land for the people must be preceded by the transformation
of the people into a firmly-knit national organization: "We
must propagate the national idea, and convert it into a
lofty moral ideal." Having become associated with the Palestinian
colonization in a practical manner, as a leading member
of the Odessa Palestine Society, founded in 1890,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Ahad Ha'am
indefatigably preached that the significance of this microscopic
colonization was not to be sought in its economic results, but
in its spiritual and cultural effects, in establishing upon the
historic soil of Judaism a nursing-ground for a pure national
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>culture which should be free from foreign admixture, and
from the inevitable cultural eclecticism of the Diaspora. After
the spectacular appearance of political Zionism on the Jewish
stage this fundamental idea of "Neo-Palestinianism" was
more fully elaborated by Ahad Ha'am, assuming the shape of
a comprehensive doctrine, known as the doctrine of "Spiritual
Zionism." When the first Basle Congress was over, Ahad
Ha'am declared that the "Jewish State," as formulated by
Herzl, was beyond realization, for the reason that, under the
prevailing circumstances, it was entirely impossible to transfer
to Palestine the whole Diaspora, or even a substantial part of it.
Consequently, the Palestinian colonization could not put an
end to the material "Jewish misery," whereas a small Jewish
center, gradually rising in Palestine, might, with the help of a
proper organization, solve the national-spiritual problem of
Judaism. The formation of a spiritual center in the historic
homeland of the nation, the creation in that center of a Jewish
national school, the revival of the Hebrew language as a medium
of daily speech, the untrammelled development of a
Jewish culture, without the pressure of a foreign environment&mdash;such
in short he held to be the true goal of the Palestine
idea. A "publicly and legally assured home for the Jewish
spirit" of this kind would exert an uninterrupted nationalizing
influence upon the Diaspora, serving as a living center of
attraction for a genuine Jewish culture, and acting like a focus
which scatters its rays over a large periphery.</p>

<p>The Zionist doctrine of Ahad Ha'am, as a counterbalance
to official Zionism which was hall-marked by the "Basle Program,"
led to interminable discussions among the partisans of
the movement. It did not succeed in creating a separate party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
or a special public agency for its realization; yet the elements
of that doctrine have mingled in a larger or lesser degree with
the views of the political Zionists in Russia, and manifested
themselves in the protests of the cultural Zionists against the
extreme political advocates of the movement at the Zionist
Congresses. The Zionist Convention at Minsk, referred to
previously, resulted in a partial triumph for the ideas
championed by Ahad Ha'am, who submitted a report on
the "Spiritual Regeneration of Judaism."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The Convention
adopted a resolution calling for a larger measure of cultural
work in the schedule of the party activities, but rejected at
the same time the proposal of the referee to create a Jewish
world organization for the revival of Jewish culture, on the
ground that such an organization might destroy the political
equilibrium of Zionism.</p>


<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Spiritual Nationalism, or National-Cultural
Autonomism</span></h3>

<p>Both political and spiritual Zionism have their roots in the
same common ground, in "the negation of the <i>Golus</i>": in
the conviction that outside of Palestine&mdash;in the lands of the
Diaspora&mdash;the Jewish people has no possibility of continuing
its existence as a normal national entity. Both political and
spiritual Zionists have their eyes equally fixed upon Zion as
the anchor of safety for Judaism, whether it be in its material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
or in its spiritual aspect. Neither doctrine had formulated a
clear idea of the future destinies of the Jewish Diaspora, that
is, of the destinies of the entire Jewry of the world, minus
the section settled in Palestine. The political Zionists evaded
the question as to the fate of the Jewish people in case their
aspirations should not materialize, and, faithful to the motto
proclaimed by Nordau, were ready, as it were, to sentence
the entire Diaspora to death, or to a life worse than death,
in the eventuality of the Palestine charter being refused. The
cultural Zionists protested against this hypothetical Zionism,
insisting that the Diaspora would preserve its national vitality
by mere contact with a small cultural center in Palestine.
But how the tremendous bulk of the Diaspora Jewry should
be organized for a Jewish life on the spot, how it should be
enabled to liberate itself from the political and cultural pressure
of the environment&mdash;that question remained unanswered
by both wings of Zionism. An answer to this question could
not be found by considering merely the last stage of Jewish
history, but by viewing the latter in all its phases, beginning
with the ancient Greco-Roman and Eastern Diaspora. Such an
answer, based upon the entire Jewish past, was attempted by
the doctrine of "Spiritual Nationalism," or, more correctly,
"National-Cultural Autonomism." Its fundamental principles
have been formulated by the present writer in his
"Letters Concerning Ancient and Modern Judaism."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<p>The theory of Autonomism takes as its point of departure
the historic fact that at all times, with the exception of a few
brief and partial deflections, the Jewish Diaspora, taken as
a whole, represented a national organism, in which the absence
of political or territorial unity was made up by the stronger
cohesion of its spiritual and cultural ties and the greater
intensity of its social and autonomous life. For many centuries
the entire culture of Judaism assumed a religious coloring
and its communal autonomy was centered in the synagogue&mdash;which
circumstance gave the modern champions of
assimilation reason for thinking that the Jews were only a
religious group scattered among various nations. It was a
fatal error on the part of the Parisian Synhedrion convoked
by Napoleon when, in its declaration of 1807, it proclaimed
that "Jewry to-day does not constitute a nation," an error
which during the nineteenth century became an article of
faith with the Jews of Western Europe. The latest development
of the national movement has shown that Jewry, though
scattered among various political states, is a nation full of
vitality, and that the Jewish religion is only one of its functions.
The Jewish national idea, secularized to a certain
degree, is based on the assumption that all sections of the
Jewish people, though divided in their political allegiance, form
one spiritual or historico-cultural nation, which, like all national
minority groups in countries with a mixed population,
are in duty bound to fight in their several lands at one and
the same time not only for their civil equality, but also for
their national rights&mdash;the autonomy of the Jewish community,
school, and language. What Jewish orthodoxy has for centuries
stood for and still stands for, under the guise of religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Judaism, progressive Jews should fight for under the banner
of a national Jewish culture. The fate of universal Jewry
ought not to be bound up with one single center. We should
take into account the historic fact of a multiplicity of centers
of which those that have the largest numbers and can boast
of the most genuine development of a national Jewish life
are entitled to the hegemony of the Jewish people. In those
lands in which civil emancipation has been achieved the fight
must go on for national emancipation, the recognition of the
Jews as a nation which is entitled to a comprehensive communal
and cultural autonomy. In Russia, the struggle must
be carried on simultaneously for civil as well as national rights.
Temporary set-backs in this struggle for a national existence
ought not to discourage a nation which has endured the most
terrible sufferings for centuries and has been able to preserve
its spiritual freedom even in the midst of slavery.</p>

<p>A certain measure of relief from these sufferings might be
found in the old-time remedy of Jewish history, in the emigration
from the lands of bondage to countries enjoying a greater
amount of freedom. If in one of the centers the Jews are
subject to prolonged persecution, then their gradual transplantation,
be it partial or complete, to another center offering
more favorable opportunities in the struggle for existence
ought to be attempted. Thus, during the last decades, the
partial exodus of the Jews from Russia has helped to create
an important Jewish center in North America and a smaller,
yet spiritually valuable center, in Palestine. The latter may
become a medium for the nationalization of the entire Diaspora,
but only then when the Diaspora itself will be organized
<i>directly</i> upon the foundations of a cultural autonomy. Zion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>ism,
when reduced to its concrete possibilities, can form only
one plank in the universal platform of the Jewish nation. The
Palestinian center may strengthen the national development
of the Diaspora, but it does not constitute a <i>conditio sine qua
non</i> for its autonomous existence.</p>

<p>Similar to Spiritual Zionism which had not succeeded in
forming a special party, and yet acted as a lever in the general
Zionist movement, Autonomism, too, failed to find its embodiment
in a party organization, and yet became an integral
part of the politico-national movements of Russian Jewry at
the beginning of the present century. During the revolutionary
struggle in Russia, in 1905 and 1906, the demand for a
national-cultural autonomy was embodied in various degrees
by nearly all Jewish parties and groups in their platforms,
aside from, and in addition to, the demand for civil equality.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>


<h3>4. <span class="smcap">The Jewish Socialistic Movement</span></h3>

<p>On a parallel line with the nationalistic ideology, which
formed a counterbalance to the assimilationist theory of Western
Europe, the doctrine of Socialism came gradually to the
fore, emphasizing the principle of the class struggle in a more
or less intimate connection with the national idea. The Jewish
labor movement was born at the end of the eighties in Lithuania&mdash;in
Vilna, and other cities; its adherents were recruited
from among the Jewish workingmen who were mainly engaged
in handicrafts. In the nineties, the movement spread to the
growing manufacturing centers of Lithuania and Poland&mdash;Bialystok,
Smorgon, Warsaw, and Lodz. At first, the labor
societies were established with a purely economic end in view&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>the
organization of strikes for fewer working hours, increased
wages, and the like. The leaders of these societies who were
recruited from among the young Jewish <i>intelligenzia</i>, some of
whom had received a university education abroad, endeavored
to model the movement upon the pattern of the West-European
Social-Democracy. The doctrine of Marxian Socialism
was applied, sometimes rather hastily, to the primitive
stage of capitalistic production in the Pale of Settlement where
it was still very difficult to draw a line of demarcation between
the poverty-stricken "petty bourgeoisie," forming the bulk of
the Jewish population, and the labor proletariat.</p>

<p>In the second half of the nineties, the Jewish Socialistic
societies were drawn into the maelstrom of the Russian
revolutionary movement. In 1897, all these societies were
consolidated in the "League of the Jewish Workingmen of
Lithuania, Poland, and Russia," known under its abbreviated
name as <i>Der Bund</i> ("The League"). The first secret convention
of the "League" took place in Vilna in the month
of September, just one month after the first Zionist Congress
at Basle. Various party centers were organized in Russia&mdash;clandestinely,
of course; the party organ, published in the
language of the Jewish masses, in Yiddish, appeared abroad
under the name of <i>Die Arbeiter Stimme</i>. It is worthy of note
that the formation of the Jewish "Bund" gave a year later
the stimulus to the organization of the "Russian Social-Democratic
Party," which united the formerly existing Russian
labor societies. The "Bund" now joined the ranks of Russian
Social Democracy as a separate autonomous group, although
a number of Jewish Social Democrats who had adopted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
viewpoint of assimilation or cosmopolitanism occupied a conspicuous
place in the leadership of the Russian party at large.</p>

<p>At subsequent conventions the "Bund" endeavored to
formulate its national program. At first, the tendency prevailed
to limit the national element in the party platform to
the use of the popular Jewish vernacular as a propaganda
medium among the masses. At the third convention of the
"Bund," which took place in Kovno in 1899, the proposal
to demand national equality for the Jews was voted down on
the ground that the attention of the workingmen should be
concentrated upon their class interests and ought not to be
diverted in the direction of national aspirations. The fourth
convention of the party, held in 1901, similarly declared "that
it was premature, under the present circumstances, to put
forward the demand for a national autonomy for the Jews,"
although it realized at the same time that "the concept of
nationality is also applicable to the Jewish people." Only
after prolonged debates in the party press, and after a violent
struggle with the centralizing tendencies of the Russian Social-Democratic
Party, the convention of the "Bund," held in
1905, adopted a resolution, demanding "national-cultural
autonomy" in the domain of popular education as well as
public rights for the language spoken by the Jews.</p>

<p>In this wise, the national element gradually permeated even
the doctrine of Socialism which, in its essence, had always
been opposed to it and had placed in its stead the principle
of internationalism and class interests. On the other hand,
an attempt was made to inject the Socialistic element into
Zionism. Beginning with 1901, the <i>Poale-Zion</i> ("The Zionist
Workingmen") began to organize themselves in separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
societies which proclaimed the territorial principle of Zionism
as the only means of solving the Jewish social-economic question,
proceeding from the assumption that in the lands of the
Diaspora the Jewish masses would always be barred from the
domain of big industry.</p>


<h3>5. <span class="smcap">The Revival of Jewish Letters</span></h3>

<p>This national revival of Russian Jewry found its expression
also in Jewish literature. The periodical press, particularly
in the Hebrew language, exhibited new life and vigor, and
in other domains of literary productivity various big talents
made their appearance. As early as the end of the eighties,
the two weekly Hebrew organs, the <i>ha-Melitz</i> in St. Petersburg,
and the <i>ha-Tzefirah</i> in Warsaw, were transformed into
dailies. The Hebrew annuals pursuing purely literary and
scientific aims, such as the <i>ha-Asif</i> ("The Harvest"), <i>Keneset
Israel</i> ("The Community of Israel"), <i>Pardes</i> ("The
Garden"), and others, made way for the more energetic
<i>ha-Shiloah</i>, a monthly publication which reacted more rapidly
on the questions of the day.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> This review, which is the equal
of the leading periodicals of Europe, exercised considerable
influence upon the views of the nationalist Jewish youth during
the period of transition from the nineteenth to the twentieth
century.</p>

<p>At one and the same time, considerable headway was made
by the periodical press in the popular vernacular, called Jargon,
or Yiddish. The <i>J&uuml;disches Volksblatt</i>, a weekly publication,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
appeared in St. Petersburg from 1881 to 1890. The
<i>Hausfreund</i>, the <i>J&uuml;dische Volksbibliothek</i>, the <i>J&uuml;dische Bibliothek</i>,
edited by Spektor, Shalom Aleichem, and I. L. Perez,
respectively, were published in Warsaw and Kiev between 1888
and 1895. <i>Der Jud</i>, a Yiddish weekly, was issued in Warsaw
in 1899-1902.</p>

<p>As for the Jewish press in the Russian language, the former
mouthpiece of the progressive <i>intelligenzia</i>, the <i>Voskhod</i>, which
appeared at the same time as a weekly and as a monthly publication,
leaned more and more towards the national movement.
Another Russian-Jewish weekly, <i>Budushchnost</i>, "The
Future," which appeared in St. Petersburg from 1899 to 1903,
was Zionistic in tendency.</p>

<p>In the theoretic branch of publicistic literature the dominant
figure during that period was Ahad Ha'am, whose articles
endeavored to answer not only the exciting questions of the
day, but also the perpetual problems of Judaism. His brief
semi-philosophic, semi-publicistic essays, under the general
heading <i>Perurim</i> ("Titbits"), served as a lode star for those
who hoped to find the synthesis of "Jew" and "man" in
modern Jewish nationalism. In a series of articles he lashes
"slavery in freedom,"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> or the assimilation of the emancipated
Jews of Western Europe; he criticizes the theory of "Nationalism
without Zion," and the manifestations of a Jewish
Nietzscheanism with its denial of the Jewish ethical doctrine.
Not satisfied with mere criticism, he formulates in these articles
the principles of a "spiritual revival"<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> in the sense of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>nationalization of Jewish culture. The essays of Ahad Ha'am,
which were subsequently collected under the title <i>'Al Parashat
Derakim</i>, "At the Parting of the Ways,"<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> represent a profound
and closely reasoned system of thought which is firmly
grounded in historico-philosophical premises.</p>

<p>In the forefront of publicists of a less theoretic turn of
mind stood the talented Nahum Sokolow, the editor of the
<i>ha-Tzefirah</i> in Warsaw, who, after some vacillation, joined the
ranks of political Zionism. In the border-land between journalism
and literary criticism the most conspicuous figures were
David Frischman and Micah Joseph Berdychevsky. The
former emphasized in his brilliant literary essays the necessity
of a "Europeanization" of Judaism, while the latter championed
the cause of Nietzcheanism, protesting against the
suppression of the "man" in the "Jew," and against the predominance
of the spiritual over the material in the doctrine of
Judaism. Berdychevsky is also the author of a number of
sketches portraying the tragic split in the soul of the Jewish
intellectual and the primitive harmoniousness of the old hasidic
world.</p>

<p>In the realm of Jewish <i>belles lettres</i> S. J. Abramovich,
known under his pen-name <i>Mendele Mokher Sforim</i>, the writer
of the "Era of Reforms," remained as theretofore the acknowledged
leader. The creative energy of this author, who mastered
with equal skill both the national and the popular language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
attained to even greater heights during the period of the new
Jewish martyrdom. His novel <i>W&uuml;nschfingerl</i>, "The Wishing
Ring," which was originally written in Yiddish, and, in its
Hebrew version, grew into a large volume, <i>Be-'Emek ha-Bakha</i>,
"In the Valley of Tears," (1897-1907), constitutes a great
epic depicting Jewish life during the gloomy reign of Nicholas
I. and the "Era of Enlightenment" under Alexander II.
A series of sketches, marked by inimitable humor, portray the
disintegration of the old mode of life under the influence
of the pogroms of 1881 and the subsequent emigration from
Russia (<i>Bime ha-Ra'ash</i>, "In Stormy Days," and others). His
autobiographical series (<i>Bayyamim Hahem</i>, "In Those Days")
and his incomplete <i>Shloime Reb Hayyims</i> ("Solomon the
son of Hayyim") reveal the power of rare psychological
analysis.</p>

<p>Abramovich's literary activity, extending over half a century,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
earned for him the title of "Grandfather of Neo-Hebrew
Literature" (<i>Der Zeide</i>).<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> He was privileged to witness the
brilliant successes of his "sons and grandsons" who came
gradually to the fore, particularly in Yiddish literature. His
younger contemporary, Isaac Leib Perez, wrote, during the
first period of his literary endeavors, clever stories, portraying
the life of the Jewish masses in Poland and distinguished by a
powerful realism, often tinged with satire (his series <i>Reisebilder</i>,
"Travel Pictures," and other sketches which were
written mostly during the nineties). Later on, Perez leaned
more and more towards modern literary symbolism, drawing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>his inspiration mostly from the mystic legends of the Hasidim
(his series <i>Hasidish</i>, which was subsequently expanded into two
volumes under the title <i>Volkst&uuml;mliche Geschichten</i>, "Popular
Stories," 1909).<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Towards the end of the century, the talent of the great Jewish
humorist Shalom Aleichem (S. Rabinovitz)<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> attained
its full bloom. He was particularly successful in his masterly
delineation of the <i>Luftmensch</i> type of the Pale of Settlement,
who is constantly on the hunt for a piece of bread, who clutches
at every possible profession and subsists on illusions (his
sketches <i>Menahem Mendel</i>). Using the popular vernacular
with its characteristic idioms and witticisms as his vehicle
of expression, Shalom Aleichem draws the pictures of the
"Little People" of the Russian ghetto (his series <i>Kleine
Menshelekh</i>), describes the joys and sorrows of their children
(<i>Maassios far J&uuml;dishe Kinder</i>, "Stories for Jewish Children"),
and puts into the mouth of the unsophisticated
philosopher of the ghetto, "Tevye (Tobias) the Dairyman,"
the soul-stirring epic of the great upheavals in this secluded
little world (the series of sketches under the name <i>Tevye Der
Milchiger</i>). To these big stars on the sky of Jewish <i>belles lettres</i>
may be added the host of lesser luminaries who write in
the rejuvenated ancient language of the nation or in the vernacular
of the masses, the Yiddish.</p>

<p>The literary revival manifested itself with particular vigor
in the domain of poetry. At the beginning of the nineties, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>voice of Judah Leib Gordon, the poet of the "Era of Reforms"<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
was silenced (he died in 1892). The singer of the
national sorrow, Simon Frug,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> who was carried away by the
new ideas of Zionism, began to sing his "Zionids" in the
Russian language, writing at the same time for the masses
sonorous poems in Yiddish, though neither of them reveals the
poetic charm of his older national elegies.</p>

<p>New stars now glisten on the horizon. The middle of the
nineties saw the ripening of the mighty talent of Hayyim
Nahman Bialik, who brought the poetical forms of ancient
Hebrew speech to unprecedented perfection. The magnificence
of form is matched by the wealth of content. The greatest
creative power of Bialik is displayed in his treatment of
national <i>motifs</i>. Himself the product of the rabbinical
Yeshibah and Bet ha-Midrash, he sings of the spiritual beauty
hidden behind these ancient and outwardly unattractive walls,
in this antiquated citadel of the Jewish spirit, where the
cult of intellectual knighthood reigned supreme, where the
spiritual shield was forged which preserved a nation of lambs
amidst a horde of wolves (his wonderful poems <i>Im Yesh Et
Nafsheka la-Da'at</i>,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> <i>ha-Matmid</i>, "the Diligent Student,"
and others). The sufferings and humiliations heaped upon his
people by its enemies bring the poet to the brink of despair,
for he realizes that the old shield has been laid aside, and
no new shield has taken its place. He is filled with indignation
at the indifference of the Jewish masses to the appeal for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>regeneration sounded by Zionism (<i>Aken Hatzir ha-'Am</i>,
"Verily, the People are like Grass," and others). At a later
stage, beginning with the Kishinev pogrom of 1903, Bialik's
lyre becomes more and more pessimistic, adopting the tone
of wrathful rebuke and fiery denunciation.</p>

<p>In contradistinction to this singer of the national soul,
another contemporary poet, Saul Chernikhovsky, sounds the
keynote of general human experience and the joy of living.
He demonstratively prostrates himself before the statue
of Apollo (<i>Lenokah Pesel Apollo</i>, "Before the Statue of
Apollo"), offering to it the repentant prayer of the Jew for
having denied the ideal of beauty. He raves about "Hellenism,"
the cult of joy and light, repudiating the one-sided
spirituality and rigorism of old Judaism. Erotic <i>motifs</i>, descriptions
of nature, ballads, rustic idylls&mdash;such are the characteristic
features of Chernokhovsky's poetry which forms, as
it were, a general human <i>pendant</i> to the poetry of Bialik,
though yielding to it in the depth of literary conception.
Both Bialik and Chernikhovsky fructified the field of Jewish
poetry, which in the beginning of the twentieth century found
a whole host of more or less talented cultivators, most of them
writing in the ancient national language, though in a rejuvenated
form.</p>

<p>Less rapid was the progress of Jewish scholarly endeavors.
Yet, beginning with the eighties, even this domain is marked
by an uninterrupted activity which forms a continuation of
the scientific achievements of the West. The nineties inaugurate
systematic efforts directed toward the elucidation of the
history of the Jews in Russia and Poland. A series of
scholarly researches, monographs, and general accounts of Jew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>ish
history, written mostly in Russian, make their appearance.
Particularly noteworthy are the efforts to blaze new paths of
Jewish historiography converging towards the national conception
of Judaism. The Jewish historians of the nineteenth
century in Western Europe, who were swayed by assimilationist
ideas, viewed Jewish history primarily from the theological
or spiritualistic point of view. The scholarly endeavors
of Russian Jewry constitute an attempt to understand the
social development of the Diaspora as a peculiar, internally-autonomous
nation which, at all times, has sought to preserve
not only its religious treasures, but also the genuine complexion
of its diversified national life.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</a><br />

THE KISHINEV MASSACRE</h2>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">Pogroms as a Counter-Revolutionary Measure</span></h3>

<p>The frenzy of political reaction, which raged for two decades,
was grist to the mill of the Revolution. Stunned by the blow it
had received at the beginning of the eighties, the Russian revolutionary
movement came back to consciousness at the beginning
of the twentieth century, when the hopes for a change
of policy on the part of Nicholas II. had been completely
blasted. The agitation among the students and the workingmen,
the "disorders" at the universities, the strikes at the
factories, the revolutionary propaganda carried on in the underground
press at home and in the public press abroad&mdash;all
these endeavors were gradually co-ordinated within the frame
of the two revolutionary organizations, the Social-Democratic
and the Social-Revolutionary parties, both of which assumed
definite shape between 1898 and 1900. The Social-Revolutionary
party favored terrorism as a weapon in its struggle
with the Russian Government, which had made use of all the
appliances of police terrorism to suppress the faintest stirring
for liberty. This official terrorism raged with unrestricted
violence. Nocturnal raids, arrests, prisons, and places of deportation
or of penal servitude, filled to overflowing with "political
criminals," mostly young men and women&mdash;such were the
agencies by means of which the Government hoped to stamp out
the "revolutionary hydra," even when manifesting itself in the
form of moderate constitutional demands. The revolutionaries
fought terrorism with terrorism, and one of their victims was
the reactionary Minister of the Interior, Sipyaghin, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
assassinated in April, 1902. The exasperated Tzar retorted
by appointing to the same office von Plehve, one of the most
experienced henchmen of the Russian political inquisition,
who had long before, in his capacity of Chief of the Political
Police, brought its mechanism to the top notch of efficiency.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
He was destined to play an ill-fated r&ocirc;le in the martyrology of
Russian Jewry.</p>

<p>It was easily to be foreseen that the Russian revolutionary
movement would make a strong appeal to the Russian Jewish
youth. Had any other cultured nation been tormented and
humiliated as cruelly and as systematically as were the Jews
in Russia it would surely have given birth to an immense
host of desperate terrorists. True, the Jews supplied the
revolutionary army with a larger number of fighters than was
warranted by their numerical proportion to the rest of the
Russian population. Yet their number was insignificant when
compared with the atrocities which were constantly perpetrated
against them. As a rule, the Jewish college youth joined the
ranks of the Social-Democratic organization, which disapproved
of political assassination. There were particularly
numerous Marxists among the Jewish young men and women
who had been turned away from the Russian institutions of
learning and had gone to Western Europe where they imbibed
the doctrines and methods of German Social Democracy.
There were fewer Jews among the Social Revolutionaries (Gershuni,
Gotz, and others), and these, too, did not as a rule
take a direct part in the terroristic plots. As a matter of
fact, the only terrorist act committed by a Jew was that of
the workingman Hirsh Lekkert, in Vilna. Stung by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
barbarous conduct of the governor of Vilna, von Wahl, who
had given orders to flog the Jewish workingmen in public
for having arranged a demonstration on May 1, 1902, Lekkert
fired upon that official. The governor escaped unscathed, and
Lekkert paid with his life for the attempt. But on the whole,
the revolutionary activity of the Jews was limited to the frequent
political demonstrations arranged by the "Bund," and
to the organizing endeavors of a certain section of the Jewish
intellectuals who had joined the ranks of both Russian Socialistic
parties.</p>

<p>Had the Russian Government been guided by a genuine
interest in the body politic, the spread of the revolutionary
movement among the Jews, which was the child of its own
system of oppression, would have inevitably induced it to mitigate
a system which was bound to turn millions of people into
desperadoes. But the Russian Government was, properly speaking,
not a Government. It was a caste of officials who had
degraded the administration of the country to the systematic
endeavor of saving their own personal careers and class
interests, both of which were indissolubly bound up with
unlimited autocracy. The Russian bureaucracy regarded the
revolution as a personal threat, as a menace to its existence,
and looked upon the Jewish participants in the revolution
as their own individual enemies whose deeds were to be
avenged upon the whole Jewish people. Thus there ripened
in the mind of Plehve, the head of the bureaucratic inquisition,
a truly devilish plan: to wage war against the Russian
revolution by waging war against the Jews, and to divert the
attention of the Russian public, which was honeycombed with
the revolutionary propaganda, in the direction of the "aliens,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
thereby stigmatizing the entire emancipatory movement in Russia
as "the work of Jewish hands," as an anti-patriotic cause
which was foreign to the Russian people. It was part of this
plan to engineer somewhere a barbarous anti-Jewish pogrom
in order to intimidate the Jewish revolutionaries and to put
it forward as a protest of the "Russian people" against
the "Jewish revolution." "Drown the revolution in Jewish
blood!"&mdash;this motto underlay the terrible scheme which, beginning
with 1903, was put into execution by the underlings of
Nicholas II. at the most crucial moments in the Russian revolutionary
movement.</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The Organized Kishinev Butchery</span></h3>

<p>Needless to say, there was plenty of inflammable material
for such an anti-Jewish conflagration. One of the criminal
haunts of these incendiaries was situated at that time in
Kishinev, the capital of semi-Moldavian Bessarabia. Until
the end of the nineteenth century, the fifty thousand Jews of
that city had lived in peace and harmony with their Christian
neighbors who numbered some sixty thousand. At the beginning
of the new century, these friendly relations were severed,
owing to the untrammelled anti-Semitic agitation of a local
yellow journalist, a petty official by the name of Krushevan.
This official had been publishing in Kishinev since 1897 a local
sheet under the name of <i>Bessarabetz</i> ("The Bessarabian").
Having originally embarked upon a moderately progressive
policy, the paper soon sold itself to the local anti-Semitic
reactionaries from among the nobility and bureaucracy, and
was thenceforth subvention-ed by the Government. For a
number of years Krushevan's paper carried on an unbridled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
agitation against the Jews. The Jews were accused of
every possible crime, of economic "exploitation," of Socialism,
of "hatred towards the Christians," of ritual murders,
and of fathering the "Godless revolution." Favored by the
powers that be, the <i>Bessarabetz</i> could do what it pleased. The
censorship of the paper lay in the hands of the deputy-governor
of Kishinev, Ustrugov, who during his administrative activity
had proved himself a past master in the art of persecuting the
Jews and curtailing the crumbs of rights that were still left to
them. Under the auspices of such a censor, who was in reality
a contributor to the paper, the latter was sure of immunity even
when it proceeded to print appeals calling on the Christian
population to make pogroms upon the Jews.</p>

<p>This agitation was particularly dangerous in view of the
fact that the <i>Bessarabetz</i> was the only press organ in the
province, the Government consistently refusing to license the
publication of any other newspaper. As a matter of fact,
Krushevan's activity in Bessarabia was so well thought of by
Plehve that in 1902 the mercenary journalist received considerable
sums from a special slush fund for the publication
of a newspaper in St. Petersburg, under the name <i>Znamya</i>
("The Banner"), with a similarly reactionary anti-Semitic
tendency. However, in the capital, the filthy sheet was unable
to find readers. But as far as the <i>Bessarabetz</i> was concerned,
its influence was clearly felt. Russian public opinion was
affected by the poisonous doses administered to it daily. The
sinister instincts of the mob became inflamed more and more,
and there was the foreboding of a storm in the air.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 1903, Krushevan found an occasion to
give a definite turn to his accustomed pogrom propaganda.
In the town of Dubossary the mutilated body of a Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
peasant boy, Rybalenko, had been found, who, as was subsequently
brought out by the judicial inquiry, had been slain
by his uncle in the hope of appropriating his portion of a
bequest. The <i>Bessarabetz</i> immediately launched a campaign
against the Jews, accusing them of ritual murder.
"Death to the Jews! Let all Zhyds be massacred!"&mdash;such
appeals were almost daily repeated in the paper which was
read in all the saloons and public-houses of Bessarabia. The
unenlightened Russian mob itched for an occasion to lay its
hands upon the Jews. An attempt at a pogrom was made
at Dubossary, but it was frustrated by the local Jews who
were of a sturdy physique.</p>

<p>On the eve of the Easter festival of 1903, mysterious rumors
were set afloat in Kishinev itself telling of the murder of
a Christian servant girl, whose death was ascribed to the
Jews. In reality the girl had taken poison and died, despite
the efforts of her Jewish master to save her life. The
goings-on in Kishinev on the eve of that Easter bore the earmarks
of an energetic activity on the part of some secret
organization which was hatching an elaborate fiendish scheme.
That criminal organization was centered in the local Russian
club which was the rallying-point of the officials of the province.
Shortly before the holiday, there suddenly appeared in
the city an emissary of the political police, the gendarmerie
officer Levendahl, who had been despatched from St. Petersburg;
after Easter, when the sanguinary crime had already
been committed, the same mysterious envoy vanished just
as suddenly.</p>

<p>The triumvirate Krushevan-Ustrugov-Levendahl was evidently
the soul of the terrible anti-Semitic conspiracy.
Printed hand-bills were scattered about in the city, telling the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
people that an imperial ukase had been published, granting
permission to inflict a "bloody punishment" upon the Jews
in the course of the three days of the Christian Passover.
The police made no attempt to suppress these circulars, for,
as was subsequently brought out, they were in the conspiracy.
Several police officials even hinted at the impending events
in their talks with Jewish acquaintances. In the saloons and
in the tea-houses, the approaching pogrom was the subject of
public discussion. The Jews were fully aware of the coming
storm, though they scarcely realized that it would take the
form not merely of an ordinary pogrom, but of a regular
butchery. On the eve of the festival of Passover, the representatives
of the Jewish community waited upon the governor and
the Chief of Police, praying for protection, and received the
cool reply that the necessary instructions had already been
given and that the proper measures for their safety had been
adopted. The local Greek-Orthodox bishop asked the rabbi,
who came to see him on the subject, whether it was true that
there was a Jewish sect which used Christian blood for ritual
purposes.</p>

<p>The conflagration which was openly prepared by the incendiaries
broke out at the moment determined upon. On
Sunday, April 6, the first day of the Christian Passover and
the seventh day of the Jewish holiday, the church bells began
to ring at noontime, and a large crowd of Russian burghers
and artisans, acting undoubtedly upon a given signal, scattered
all over the town, and fell upon the Jewish houses and stores.
The bands were preceded by street urchins who were throwing
stones at the windows. The rioters, whose number was
swelled by these youthful "fighters," seeing that the police<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
made no attempt to interfere, began to break into the houses
and stores, and to throw the contents on the street where everything
was destroyed or plundered by the festive crowd. But
even then the police and soldier detachments who were stationed
on the streets remained passive, and made no attempt to
arrest the rioters. This attitude served in the eyes of the
mob as a final proof that the rumors concerning the permission
of the Tzar "to beat the Jews" were correct. An immense
riff-raff, in a state of intoxication, crowded the streets, shouting
"Death to the Zhyds! Beat the Zhyds!"</p>

<p>In the evening looting gave way to killing. The murderers,
armed with clubs and knives, assailed the Jews in the cars,
on the streets, and in the houses, wounding them severely,
sometimes even fatally. Even then, the police and military
remained inactive; only when in one place a group of Jews,
armed with sticks, attempted to drive off the murderers, the
police stepped in at once and disarmed the defenders.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock in the evening the looting and killing were
suddenly stopped. Rumor had it that the general staff of
the rioters were holding a meeting concerning the further plan
of military operations, and were making arrangements for a
systematic butchery. The "army" soon received the necessary
orders, and in the course of the entire day of April 7,
from daybreak until eight o'clock in the evening, Kishinev
was the scene of bestialities such as find few parallels even
in the history of the most barbarous ages. Finding themselves
defenceless and exposed to the passions of a savage
crowd, many Jewish families hid themselves in their cellars,
or in their garrets, and sometimes sought safety in the houses
of their Christian neighbors, but the murderers succeeded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
hunting down their unfortunate victims. The Jews were slain
in most barbarous fashion. Many of them were not killed
at once, but were left writhing in pre-mortal agonies. Some
had nails driven into their heads or had their eyes put out.
Little children were thrown from garrets to the pavement,
and their brains dashed out upon the stones. Women had
their stomachs ripped open or their breasts cut off. Many of
them became the victims of rape. One gymnazium pupil who
saw his mother attacked by these fiends threw himself single-handed
upon them, and saved at the cost of his life his mother's
honor; he himself was slain, and his mother's eyes were put
out. The drunken hordes broke into the synagogue, and,
getting hold of the Torah scrolls, tore them to shreds, defiled
them, and trampled upon them. In one synagogue, the old
<i>Shammes</i> (beadle), arrayed in his prayer-shawl, and shielding
with his body the Ark containing the sacred scrolls, was
savagely murdered by the desecrators on the threshold of the
sanctuary.</p>

<p>Throughout the entire day, wagons were seen moving in
the streets, carrying wounded and slain Jews to the hospitals
which had been converted into field-lazarettes.</p>

<p>But even this sight did not induce the police to step in. The
Russian population, outside of a few isolated cases, made no
attempt to defend the tormented Jews. The so-called "intelligent"
public, the officials with their wives and children, the
students, the lawyers, the physicians, walked leisurely upon
the streets and looked on indifferently, and sometimes even
sympathetically, while the terrible "work" was going on. The
governor of Bessarabia, von Raaben, who, on the morning
of the second day of the pogrom, was waited upon by a Jewish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
deputation begging for protection, replied that he could do
nothing since he had received no instructions from St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>At last at five o'clock in the afternoon, a telegram was received
from Plehve, and at six o'clock large detachments of
troops, fully armed, appeared on the central streets. No
sooner had the crowd noticed that the soldiers were ready to
act than it took to its heels, without a single shot being fired.
Only in the outskirts of the town, which had not yet been
reached by the troops, the plunder and massacre continued
until late in the evening.</p>

<p>It is needless to point out that had this readiness of the
police and military to attend to their duty been displayed in
Kishinev at the inception of the pogrom, not a single Jew would
have been murdered nor a single house destroyed. As it
was, the murderers and rioters were given a free hand for
two days, and the result was that forty-five Jews were slain,
eighty-six severely wounded or crippled, five hundred slightly
wounded, apart from cases of rape, the number of which could
not be determined. Fifteen hundred houses and stores were
demolished and looted. The victims were mostly among the
lower classes of the Jewish population, since many well-to-do
Jewish families were able, by bribing the police heavily, to
secure the protection of the latter and to have the rioters turned
away from their houses. As against the enormous number of
Jewish victims, there were only two fatalities among the intoxicated
rioters. The Kishinev Jews seemed unable to resist the
murderers and sell their lives dearly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>


<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Echoes of the Kishinev Tragedy</span></h3>

<p>A cry of horror rang throughout Russia and the more or
less civilized countries of the world when the news of the
Kishinev butchery became known. The entire liberal Russian
press voiced its indignation against the Kishinev atrocities.
The most prominent Russian writers expressed their sympathy
with the victims in letters and telegrams. Leo Tolstoi voiced
his sentiments in a letter which could not be published on
account of the censorship.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The humanitarian writer Korolenko
portrayed the horrors of Kishinev in a heart-rending
story under the title "House No. 13," in which, on the
basis of personal observation, he pictured how the Jewish residents
of one house were tortured to death by the rioters. The
story was circulated in an illegal edition, its publication having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
been strictly forbidden by the censor. But in Russia itself,
the cry was stifled by the heavy hand of Plehve's censorship,
and wherever a fraction of the terrible truth managed to slip
through the barriers of the censor, Plehve sent out warnings
to the papers threatening to discontinue their publication for
the "pursuit of an injurious policy." Such a fate actually
overtook the Russian-Jewish <i>Voskhod</i>, in St. Petersburg, the
legal journal <i>Pravo</i> ("The Law"), and others. The entire
Russian press was forced by the Government to publish the
falsified version embodied in its official reports, in which the
organized massacre was toned down to a casual brawl, and
the inactivity of the troops was explained either by the inadequacy
of their numbers&mdash;despite the fact that several battalions
were stationed in the city&mdash;or by the incapacity of the police,
while the dead and wounded were referred to in a vague manner
so as to suggest that the victims of the "brawl" were
to be found on both sides.</p>

<p>But the revelations in the foreign press were of a nature to
stagger all Europe and America. The correspondent of the
London <i>Times</i> published the text of a secret letter addressed
by Plehve to the governor of Bessarabia, in which, two weeks
before the pogrom, the latter official was told that, in the case
of anti-Jewish "disorders," "no recourse shall be taken to
armed interference with the urban population, so as not to
arouse hostility to the Government in a population which has
not yet been affected by the revolutionary propaganda." The
authenticity of this letter is not entirely beyond suspicion.
But there can be no doubt that instructions to that effect,
rather by word of mouth than in writing, probably through
the secret agent Levendahl, had been actually transmitted to
the authorities in Kishinev.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>From the fact that on the second day of the pogrom the
governor was still waiting for instructions from St. Petersburg
permitting him to discontinue the massacre it is evident
that he must have received previous orders to allow it to proceed
up to a certain point. The horrors of the Armenian massacres
in Turkey, against which even Russian diplomacy had
protested more than once, faded into insignificance before the
wholesale butchery at Kishinev. Europe and America were
deeply agitated. The Jews outside of Russia collected large
funds for their unhappy Russian brethren, but their efforts
exhausted themselves in sympathy and philanthropy.</p>

<p>The effect of the catastrophe upon Russian Jewry was more
lasting. A mixed feeling of wrath and shame seized the Jewish
public&mdash;wrath against the organizers and abetters of the
terrible crime, and shame for the tortured and degraded
brethren who, not having a chance to save their lives, had
failed to save their honor by offering stout resistance to
these beasts in human shape, who were sure of immunity.
The poet Frug poured forth his sentiments in a Yiddish poem,
voicing his sorrow at the physical helplessness of his nation
and confining himself to an appeal to the kind Jewish heart:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Too keen and grievous is our pain, too weak our hand the blow to parry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come on, then, tender Jewish heart, and love and comfort to us carry!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brothers, sisters, pray, have pity; dire and dreadful is our need:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrouds we want the dead to bury, and bread that the living we may feed.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<p>A little later, the young poet Bialik gave powerful utterance
to his feeling of wrath and shame in his "Burden of
Nemirov."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> He makes God address these words to the martyred
nation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your dead have died in vain, and neither you nor I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can say for what they gave their lives, and why....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No tears shall flow for you!&mdash;the Lord swears by His Name&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For though the pain be great, great also is the shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And which of them the greater, thou, son of man, decide....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In picturing the memorial services held in honor of the
Kishinev victims at the synagogues, he angrily exclaims in
the name of God:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lift thine eyes and look how steeped they are in grief.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You hear them cry and sob and mournful prayers read.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see them beat their breasts and for forgiveness plead....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What are they praying for?... Tell them to protest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shake their fists at Me and justice to demand!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Justice for all they've suffered throughout the generations,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that My Heaven and Throne shall quake to their foundations!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Neither the pogroms at the beginning of the eighties, nor
the Moscow atrocities at the beginning of the nineties can
compare, in their soul-stirring effect upon Russian Jewry, with
the massacre of Kishinev. It awakened the burning feeling
of martyrdom, but with it also the feeling of heroism. All
were seized by one and the same impulse&mdash;the organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
of self-defence, as if to say: "Since the Government fails to
defend our life and honor, then we ourselves are bound to
defend it." The pogrom panic which spread over the entire
South following upon the terrible days of April 6-7 led to
the organization of self-defence societies in a number of cities.
Plehve knew of these preparations, and found himself in a
difficult position. He realized that these endeavors might interfere
with the engineering of the pogroms, since the latter
would no longer be safe for the murderers and plunderers,
and he was, moreover, full of apprehension that these self-defence
societies might become hotbeds of a revolutionary propaganda
and provide a training ground for political demonstrations.
These apprehensions were voiced in a circular issued
at the end of April, in which the Minister instructed the
governors, first, that "no self-defence societies should be tolerated,"
and, second, that the authorities should adopt measures
for the "prevention of violence" and the "suppression of
lawlessness." Subsequent events showed that the latter order
was never put into effect. The first instruction, however, was
carried out with relentless cruelty, and, during the following
pogroms, the troops made it their first business to shoot down
the members of the self-defence.</p>

<p>Such being the frame of mind of Russian Jewry, the ukase
of May 10, 1903, opening up to the Jews for "free domicile"
one hundred and one localities in various governments of the
Pale of Settlement, which had hitherto been barred to them
under the "Temporary Rules" of 1882, was received with
complete indifference. As a matter of fact, many of the rural
settlements, included in that ukase, were in reality towns which
had been converted into "villages," at the instigation of spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>ful
officials, for the sole purpose of rendering them inaccessible
to the Jews. The stolen property was now returned with a
slight surplus. The Danaid gift, which seemed to be offered
to the Jews as a compensation for the Kishinev horrors, could
not but fill them with disgust. Parenthetically it may be
remarked that the Government itself nullified the moral effect
of its "act of grace" by issuing on the same day a new repressive
law prohibiting the privileged Jews who were entitled to
the right of domicile outside the Pale of Settlement from acquiring
real property in the villages and hamlets. The knot
of rightlessness was loosened by a hair's breadth in one place,
and tightened in another.</p>

<p>Grief and shame over "the Kishinev days" armed the hand
of Pincus Dashevski, a high-minded Jewish youth, against the
most culpable instigator of the massacre&mdash;Krushevan. Dashevski,
the son of a military surgeon, travelled from Kiev, where he
was a student at the Polytechnicum, to St. Petersburg to
inflict punishment on the miserable hireling of Jud&aelig;ophobia,
who had caused the Kishinev conflagration by his criminal
newspaper agitation. On June 4, 1903, he assailed Krushevan
in the heart of the capital, on the so-called Nevski Prospect,
wounding him in the neck with a knife. The wound proved
of no consequence, and the "victim" was able to go home,
without accepting the first aid proffered to him in a Jewish
drug store nearby. Dashevski was arrested and brought to
trial. At the preliminary examination he frankly confessed
that he had intended to avenge the Kishinev massacre by killing
Krushevan. Krushevan, now more ferocious than ever,
demanded in his newspaper <i>Znamya</i> that the Jewish avenger
be court-martialled and executed, and his demand was echoed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
by the entire anti-Semitic press. The case was tried in a
district court behind closed doors, the Government of Plehve
evidently fearing the appearance of the sanguinary ghost of
Kishinev in the court-room.</p>

<p>Krushevan was represented by the anti-Semitic lawyer
Shmakov, who subsequently figured in the Beilis trial. The
counsel for Dashevski (the lawyer Gruzenberg and others)
pleaded that his client's act had been inspired by the intention
not to kill, but merely to voice his protest against the
unbridled criminal activity of Krushevan. Dashevski received
the severe sentence of penal military service for five years
(August 26). An appeal was taken to the Senate, but the
judgment of the lower court was sustained. The youth who,
in a fit of righteous indignation, had given vent to the outraged
feelings of his martyred nation, was put in chains and
sent into the midst of murderers and thieves, while the venal
instigator, whose hands were stained with the blood of numerous
victims, escaped unscathed, and assisted by public funds,
continued his criminal activity of fanning the hatred of the
populace against the Jews.</p>


<h3>4. <span class="smcap">Doctor Herzl's Visit to Russia</span></h3>

<p>The alert bureaucratic mind of Plehve was quick to make
its deductions from the Dashevski case. He realized that the
Kishinev massacre would inflame the national Jewish sentiment
and divert the national or Zionist cause into the channel
of the revolutionary movement. Accordingly, on June 24,
1903, Plehve issued a circular to the governors, which was
marked "strictly confidential," and sent out through the Police
Department, ordering the adoption of energetic measures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
against "the propaganda of the ideas of Zionism," which had
departed from its original aim&mdash;the transfer of Jews to Palestine&mdash;and
"had directed its activity towards strengthening the
Jewish national idea," preaching "the organization of the
Jews in secluded societies in the places of their present
domicile." Acting upon these orders, the police began to
persecute the Zionists in a number of cities, prohibiting the
sale of Jewish Colonial Trust shares, collections for the Jewish
National Fund, and meetings and conferences of the Zionist
societies.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, on July 25, the leader of the Zionists,
Dr. Herzl, arrived in St. Petersburg to induce the Russian
authorities to discontinue these persecutions. Apart from this
immediate object, Herzl had another more important mission
in mind. He hoped to obtain a promise from the Russian
Government to exert a diplomatic pressure upon Turkey in
favor of permitting the settlement of Jews in Palestine on a
large scale. During his four interviews with Plehve, the Zionist
leader succeeded in convincing the minister that "it was in
keeping with the interests of the Russian Government to assist
the Zionist movement." Plehve replied&mdash;and subsequently
confirmed his reply in writing&mdash;that the Russian Government
was willing to help Zionism so long as its political activity
would be directed towards the attainment of its aims outside of
Russia, towards the creation of a Jewish center in Palestine and
the emigration of the Jews from Russia, but that as soon as the
movement would be turned inwards, that is, towards the propaganda
of the Jewish national idea and the organization of
Jewry in Russia itself, it would not be tolerated, being subversive
of the Russian national policies. Herzl assured Plehve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
that political Zionism <i>sans phrase</i> had no other aim in view,
except the creation of a center outside of the Diaspora.</p>

<p>Both Plehve and Herzl seemed to be satisfied with the results
of their conversation. Herzl saw also the Minister of Finance,
Witte, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lamsdorff, and left
St. Petersburg in a hopeful mood. On his way to St. Petersburg,
particularly during his stay in Vilna, Herzl was the object
of stormy ovations by the Zionists. At the same time, he was
severely criticized by the representatives of other Jewish political
groups who thought that he had lowered the national
dignity of the Jewish people by conducting negotiations for the
salvation of Jewry with the man on whose forehead was
stamped the Cain's mark of Kishinev.</p>

<p>It seems that the severe crisis which had set in for political
Zionism, when the hope for obtaining a charter from the Sultan
had receded into a distance, had impelled Herzl to catch at a
straw, at negotiations with the Russian Government. He was
evidently of the opinion that the Russian Pharaohs who had
countenanced the methods of reducing the Jewish population
in Russia, such as had been practised at Kishinev, might be
willing to achieve the same object by rendering its diplomatic
assistance to the Zionist plans. A pledge in this direction was
actually given to Herzl. But Herzl overestimated the importance
of the promises made to him by potentates who merely
looked upon him as a noble-minded dreamer.</p>

<p>Two weeks after Herzl's visit to St. Petersburg, the acuteness
of the Zionist crisis manifested itself at the sixth Congress
at Basle (August 11-16, 1903). On that occasion
Herzl announced his new project, the colonization of Uganda,
in British East Africa, by virtue of a charter which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
offered to him by the British Government. He pointed out that
this project had a definite aim in view&mdash;the amelioration of the
terrible condition of Russian Jewry, for which purpose Zion
at that particular moment was not available. Herzl's pronouncement
rent the Congress in twain: one section seized
enthusiastically upon the Uganda project, which held out the
promise of at least a temporary shelter in Africa, a <i>Nachtasyl</i>,
for a part of the agonized nation. The other section protested
violently against this attempt to create a "Zionism without
Zion," against the abandonment of Palestine and the higher
aspirations of the movement. After many stormy and soul-stirring
scenes, the majority of the Congress adopted a
resolution to send an expedition to Uganda to investigate the
proffered country from the point of view of its fitness for
Jewish colonization. Thereupon, all the opponents of the
Uganda project, the so-called <i>Neinsager</i> (the "Nay-sayers"),
mostly Russian Zionists, left the Congress hall in a body.</p>

<p>The movement was now rent by a severe conflict, the result of
the struggle between the two principles which had long been
intermingled in the theoretic foundations of Zionism: Palestinianism
and Territorialism. This internal conflict culminated
in an open split between these two principles. Out
of the Zionist movement was born the Territorialist Organization,
which proclaimed as its object the creation of a Jewish
autonomous center on any available point of the globe. For the
blood of Kishinev cried out for an exodus from the new Egypt.
The emigration to the United States, where the prisoners of
Tzardom had in the course of twenty years, beginning with
1881, succeeded in forming a big Jewish center, had passed
the million mark, and was expected to assume larger and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
larger dimensions. The Jewish public press insisted on the
necessity "of regulating the emigration to America not only
as a social-economic, but also as a national factor." It was
pointed out that a considerable portion of the historic national
center in Russia and Poland was, under the pressure of external
events, in the process of removing to North America, and that
practical Jewish politics had the direct duty of organizing this
great rising center of Jewry.</p>

<p>"My opinion concerning the Kishinev crime is the result also of

was published in the papers, not yet knowing all the appalling
details which were communicated subsequently, I fully realized
the horror of what had taken place, and experienced simultaneously
a burning feeling of pity for the innocent victims of
the cruelty of the populace, amazement at the bestiality of all these
so-called Christians, revulsion at all these so-called cultured people
who instigated the mob and sympathized with its actions. But I
felt a particular horror for the principal culprit, our Government
with its clergy which fosters in the people bestial sentiments and
fanaticism, with its horde of murderous officials. The crime committed
at Kishinev is nothing but a direct consequence of that
propaganda of falsehood and violence which is conducted by the
Russian Government with such energy. The attitude adopted by
the Russian Government in relation to this question may only
serve as a new proof of the class egotism of this Government,
which stops at no cruelty whenever it finds it necessary to check
movements that are deemed dangerous by it. Like the Turkish
Government at the time of the Armenian massacres, it remains
entirely indifferent to the most horrible acts of cruelty, as long as
these acts do not affect its interests."</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV</a><br />

CONTINUED POGROMS AND THE RUSSO-JAPANESE
WAR</h2>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">The Pogrom at Homel and the Jewish Self-Defence</span></h3>

<p>No sooner had the Zionist Congress, at which the heated discussions
concerning the salvation of Judaism were intermingled
with sobs bemoaning the martyrs of Kishinev, concluded
its sessions than a new catastrophe broke out in the
dominions of the Tzar&mdash;the pogrom at Homel, in the Government
of Moghilev. In this lively White-Russian town, in
which the twenty thousand Jews formed fully one-half of
the population, public Jewish life was marked by great vigor.
There existed in the city important societies of Zionists and
Socialists. Both of these parties had organized several self-defence
contingents, and it was to be expected that the disgrace
of Kishinev would not be repeated at Homel, and that,
in the case of an attack, the Jews would give a good account of
themselves.</p>

<p>On August 29, 1903, a fight broke out on the market-place
between a crowd of Jews and Christians. The cause of the
quarrel was a trivial incident, one peasant trying to carry off
from a Jewish store a barrel of herrings at a lower price than
the one demanded by the storekeeper. The rowdyish purchaser
was pushed out of the store, but the peasants on the market-place
took sides with him, and in the ensuing fight between
them and the Jew, one peasant was accidently killed. The peasants
were scared and took to their heels, while the police began
to make arrests among the Jews. The Jews might have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
satisfied with the fact that their energetic attitude had succeeded
in preventing a pogrom, did they not anticipate the
revenge which was sure to be wreaked upon them.</p>

<p>Two days passed in a state of tense agitation. On the third
day, on September 1, a crowd of Russian workingmen, numbering
about two hundred, issued forth from the railroad shops,
and began to demolish Jewish residences and houses of worship.
The rioters were joined by a mob of stone-cutters, day-laborers,
and ragamuffins. Here and there the crowd was
incited by a few "intellectuals": a merchant, a student, and a
teacher. On the Konnaya Square, the mob was checked by a
large detachment of the Jewish self-defence, consisting of
several hundred men. The rioters were on the point of giving
way before the gallant attack of the self-defence; but at that
moment the troops appeared on the scene, and fired a volley
in the direction of the Jews, resulting in three killed and several
wounded. The assistance rendered by the troops filled the
rioters with fresh courage, and they continued their work of
destruction with renewed vigor. All over the town a chain of
soldiers shielded the attacking hordes against the Jewish self-defence
contingents which tried in vain to break through the
chain. The defenders were driven off with rifle butts and
bayonets, while the rioters were allowed to destroy and murder
without let or hindrance. In the evening, the pogrom was
stopped; the results were twelve killed or dangerously wounded
Jews, eight killed or dangerously wounded Christians, a large
number of maltreated and slightly wounded Jews and over two
hundred and fifty devastated Jewish residences and stores.
Among those arrested by the police was a considerably larger
number of self-defending Jews than of attacking Christians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Two days later, the governor of Moghilev came to Homel,
and, having summoned the Jews to the Town Council, treated
them to the following harangue:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am sorry for the unhappy victims, but how could such bitterness
have arisen? Religious toleration in Russia is complete.
The causes of the latest events lie deeper. The Jews have now
become the leaders and instigators in all movements directed
against the Government. This entire "Bund" and the Social-Democrats&mdash;they
are all Jews. You are yourselves to blame for
all that has happened. You do not educate your children properly.
You have no influence over them. But at least you can
surrender them, pointing them out to the Government, whereas
you conceal them. You propagate disobedience and opposition to
the Government among an uncivilized population. But the Russian
populace does not care for it and turns against you.</p></div>

<p>It would seem as if Plehve himself had spoken through the
mouth of the governor. The Russian functionary expressed
with na&iuml;ve and clumsy frankness the hidden thought of the
Chief of the Political Inquisition&mdash;the idea of punishing the
fathers for the revolutionary leanings of their children, who
were to be surrendered to the police, and of discrediting the
entire Russian liberty movement as a "Jewish cause." In a
Government communication which appeared after the pogrom
the events at Homel were reported in such a way as to suggest
that they were brought about by an attack of the Jews upon
Christian residents and upon the troops, in consequence of
which the latter had been forced to fire in "self-defence." The
final deduction was formulated thus: "The cause of the disorders
lies in the extremely hostile and defiant attitude of the
local Jews toward the Christians." Thus were the actual
facts distorted in an official document, and the tortured were
put forward as the torturers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>The Homel pogrom did not attain to the dimensions of
the Kishinev massacre, nor was it as painful to the moral
consciousness of the Jews. For in Homel the Jews did not
allow themselves to be beaten and slaughtered like sheep, but
put up a valiant defence. Had the troops not turned against
the self-defence, the pogrom would not have taken place, and
the cowardly rabble would have taken to flight before the gallant
defenders of their national honor. Already in the spring,
Plehve had foreseen that the Jews would attempt to organize
a self-defence of their own, and he had in his previously mentioned
circular declared in advance that this most fundamental
right of human beings to defend their lives was "inadmissible."
Accordingly, several Jewish heroes paid with their
lives for having violated this ministerial circular. Their death
was the foreboding of a new Jewish martyrdom. All this had
the natural effect of enormously intensifying the revolutionary
sentiments of the Jewish youth and of inspiring them with
hatred towards a r&eacute;gime which permitted some of its citizens
to commit murder and prohibited others to defend their lives.</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The Kishinev Massacre at the Bar of Russian
Justice</span></h3>

<p>In the fall of 1903 the judicial investigation in connection
with the spring pogrom in Kishinev was nearing its end. The
investigation was conducted with a view to obliterating
the traces of the deliberate organization of the pogrom. The
representatives of Government authority and of the better
classes whose complicity in the Kishinev massacre had been
clearly established were carefully eliminated from the trial,
and only the hired assassins and plunderers from among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
lower classes, numbering about four hundred men, were
brought to justice. Prompted by fear lest the terrible truth
might leak out in the court, the Ministry of Justice ordered
the case to be tried behind closed doors. By this act, the
blood-stained Russian Government refused in advance to rehabilitate
itself before the civilized world, which looked upon
it as the instigator of the catastrophe.</p>

<p>In the court proceedings, the echo of which penetrated beyond
the walls of the closed court-room, the counsel for the defence
from among the best representatives of the Russian bar
(Karabchevski, Sokolov, and others, who were Christians, and
the Jews Gruzenberg, Kalmanovich, and others) succeeded in
proving that the prisoners at the bar were only blind tools
in the commission of the crime, whereas the organizers of the
butchery and the ringleaders of the mob were escaping justice.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
They demanded that the case be probed to the bottom.
The court refused their demand, whereupon the lawyers, having
stated their reasons, withdrew from the court-room one
after the other.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The only advocates left were the anti-Semite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>Shmakov and other whole-hearted defenders of the Kishinev
massacre, who regarded the latter as a manifestation of the
honor and conscience of the Russian people. In the end, the
court sentenced a score of murderers and rioters of the first
group to hard labor or penal service, dismissing at the same
time the civil actions for damages presented by the Jews.</p>

<p>Six months later the Kishinev case came up before the
Senate, the Jews appearing as complainants against Governor
von Raaben (who had been dismissed after the pogrom),
Deputy-Governor Ustrugov, and the Kishinev Chief of Police,
upon whom they fastened the responsibility. The bureaucratic
defendants cynically declared "that the losses suffered
by the Jews have been covered many times over by contributions
from Russia, Western Europe, and America." All
the eloquence of the well-known lawyer Vinaver and of his
associates failed to convince the judges of the Senate, and the
petition for damages was dismissed. The Government did not
wish to create a precedent for compensating pogrom victims
out of public funds, for "this might place the representatives
of the administration in an impossible position," as was
stated with na&iuml;ve frankness by von Raaben, since it might
become necessary to increase the imperial budget by several
million rubles a year.</p>

<p>In the midst of these ghastly proceedings Plehve conceived
the plan of "regulating the legislation concerning the Jews."
In August, 1903, he sent out a circular to the governors, calling
upon them, in view of the extraordinarily complex and tangled
condition of the Russian laws affecting the Jews, to point out
ways and means "of bringing these legal enactments into
proper order and into as harmonious a system as possible."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
In reply to this circular, the governor of Vilna, Pahlen, submitted
an extensive memorial, in which he pointed out that
all the restrictive laws within the boundaries of the Pale of
Settlement ought to be repealed on account of their pernicious
political influence, since they were driving the Jews into the
ranks of the paupers or revolutionaries. At the same time he
suggested to retain the repressive measures "against the
manifestation of the injurious characteristics of Judaism on
the part of certain individuals" and also to exclude the Jewish
youth from the Christian schools and establish for them
special elementary and intermediate schools under the supervision
of Christian teachers. A few other governors, among
them the new governor of Bessarabia, Urussov, also expressed
themselves in favor of mitigating the repressive policy against
the Jews.</p>

<p>In January, 1904, a committee of governors and of several
high officials representing the Ministry of the Interior met to
consider the Jewish question. From the very beginning the
conferees were given to understand that in "the highest
spheres" every thought of the slightest mitigation of the condition
of Jewry was taboo. The only liberal member of the
committee, Governor Urussov, subsequently stated that after
the Kishinev pogrom and the agitation raised by it "one could
feel quite tangibly the unfriendly attitude of the highest
spheres toward the Jews"&mdash;in other words, that the hatred
toward the Jews was shared personally by the Tzar and by his
<i>camarilla</i>. The committee therefore applied itself to the task,
not of reforming Jewish legislation, but rather of systematizing
the anti-Jewish code of laws. Its labors were interrupted by
the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, on January 27, 1904.</p>

<h3>3. <span class="smcap">The Jews in the Russo-Japanese War</span></h3>

<p>On the day following the declaration of war, the organ of
Russian Jewry, the <i>Voskhod</i>, wrote as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is not the time to irritate the old wounds. Let us endeavor,
as far as it is in our power, to forget also the recent
expulsion from Port Arthur,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> the pogroms of Kishinev and Homel,
and many, many other things.... Let the Jewish parents not
think of the bitter fate of their children who had been thrown
overboard [by being barred from the educational establishments].
The Jews will go forth into battle as plain soldiers, without any
hope of attaining an officer's rank, or shoulder-straps, or distinctions&mdash;the
blood of our sons will flow as freely as that of the
Russians.</p></div>

<p>The Jews marched to the Far East to assist Russia in making
the province of Manchuria part of Siberia in which they were
forbidden to reside. The number of Jews at the front was
disproportionately large&mdash;it amounted to some thirty thousand,
owing to the fact that, in accordance with the usual military
regulations, the Jewish recruits from the Western governments
were generally despatched to Siberia, so that, at the very
outset, they were near the theatre of military operations.
Disproportionately large was also the number of Jewish
physicians in the reserves. They were mobilized at once, evidently
for the reason that they lived on their private practice
and were not allowed to occupy any state or public office,
whereas the Russian physicians were not drawn upon to the
same extent, so as not to divert them from their administrative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
municipal, or Zemstvo services.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Hundreds of Jewish
physicians had to work and to encounter the murderous fire
of the Japanese because of the fact that an unjust law deprived
them of the right of civil service in time of peace.</p>

<p>While scores of thousands of disfranchised Jews were fighting
for the prestige of Russia in the Far East, the whip of
rightlessness did not cease to lash their brethren at home. In
a number of places the authorities began to expel the families
of the soldiers and physicians who had been sent to the war, on
the ground that with the departure of the head of the family
the wife and children had forfeited the right of residence, the
latter being conditioned by the profession of the husband or
father. This policy, however, was too monstrous even for St.
Petersburg, and Plehve was soon forced to decree that the
families of the mobilized Jews should be left in their places
of residence, "pending the termination of the war."</p>

<p>Though the Government was compelled to relax for a while
its oppression of the Jews, social Jud&aelig;ophobia, fanned by
the chauvinism incident to war time, broke out with greater
violence than ever. Irritated by the rapid failures of the Russian
arms and by the unexpected military superiority of the
Japanese, the reactionary press, headed by the <i>Novoye Vremya</i>,
began to circulate preposterous rumors to the effect that the
Jews were secretly helping the Japanese, their "kinsmen by
race," in order to wreak their vengeance upon Russia for having
perpetrated the Kishinev massacres. The story of the Jewish-Japanese
alliance issued from the public press of the capital to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
make its rounds through the provinces, and each day gave birth
to a rumor more absurd than the other: the Jews are exporting
gold abroad, they are purchasing horses for Japan, they are
collecting money to build cruisers for the Mikado, they are
provoking England and America against Russia, and similar
preposterous stories. It was clear that these rumors were the
work of a gang of unscrupulous agitators <i>&agrave; la</i> Krushevan, who
were eager to instigate anti-Jewish pogroms on a modern
basis&mdash;the accusation of "treachery." This assumption is
confirmed by the additional fact that these incendiary rumors
were particularly circulated in February and March, before
the Easter festival, the old-time pogrom season, just as in the
preceding year the ritual murder libel of Dubossary had been
kept afloat during the same months. "The incendiaries have
already set out upon their work"&mdash;with these words the Jewish
organ <i>Voskhod</i> warned its readers in its issue of March 11. A
week later, the same paper had occasion to publish accounts of
the panic which had spread among the Jewish population, particularly
in the South. In Kishinev, a second pogrom was
feared, calling forth an intensified emigration to America. In
Odessa, the Jews were agitated by sinister rumors, and began
to prepare themselves for self-defence. This state of alarm was
reflected in the foreign press. It was rumored that the
American ambassador at St. Petersburg had received instructions
to make representations to the Russian Government&mdash;which
rumor was subsequently officially denied.</p>

<p>Fortunately the Government itself came to the conclusion
that the time of war was not a fit opportunity for
arranging pogroms. The governors received orders to adopt
energetic measures for the prevention of Passover excesses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Governor Urussov of Bessarabia and the city-governor of
Odessa addressed serious warnings to the Russian population.
These steps had the desired effect. As soon as the police and
population realized that the pogroms were not desired from
above, the agitation collapsed; and in April the papers were
able to tell their readers that "Passover has passed quietly
everywhere." In his <i>Memoirs</i> Urussov tells us that, during the
restless day preceding the Easter festival in Kishinev, he
had been engaged, together with the Chief of Police, in working
out a plan looking to the maintenance of public order in the
city; during this conference he noticed that the Chief of
Police was rather hesitant and puzzled. This hesitation continued
until the governor received from Plehve a telegram in
cipher, calling upon him to prevent pogroms. No sooner had
Urussov shown the Chief of Police the deciphered telegram
than the latter exclaimed: "Don't trouble yourself&mdash;now there
will be no disorders in Kishinev." Such was the spirit in
which the provincial administrators had been trained. Without
a special order from St. Petersburg, they did not have the
courage to suppress the pogroms.</p>


<h3>4. <span class="smcap">The "Political Spring"</span></h3>

<p>On the morning of July 15, 1904, the square before the
Warsaw dep&ocirc;t in St. Petersburg presented a terrible sight.
Upon the pavement lay the blood-stained body of Plehve, who
had been smitten by the bomb of the Russian terrorist Sazonov
while on his way to Peterhof where he was to report to the Tzar.
This meant that the revolution had again raised its head.
After two years of frenzied police terrorism, and in spite of all
attempts to divert the attention of the public from the neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>sity
of reforms, first by pogroms and then by the war against
Japan&mdash;Plehve had insisted upon the declaration of war, hoping
to drown the "seditious" movement in chauvinism&mdash;the
revolutionary spectre was once more haunting the country.
The martyrs of the autocratic inquisition perceived the "finger
of God" in the calamities caused by the war and in the miserable
end of Plehve. In February, 1904, the Russian censor
confiscated an issue of the <i>Voskhod</i> in which a young Jewish
sibyl, in a poem entitled "To Haman," referring to the biblical
<i>Mene, Mene, Tekel u-Farsin</i>, predicted a shameful death
for the new Haman who was easily identified as the hero of
Kishinev. One could feel in the air the coming of a cleansing
tempest. Even the reactionary Government was taken aback
by the approaching storm. It did not dare to answer the
terrorism of the revolution with police terrorism. On the
contrary, it made an attempt to moderate the r&eacute;gime of
serfdom.</p>

<p>On August 11, on the occasion of the birth of the heir-apparent
Alexis, an imperial manifesto was issued, granting
"favors" and "privileges" to the population, the most important
of which consisted in the abrogation of corporal punishment
for peasants and soldiers. On the same day, a ukase
was promulgated in which the Tzar "thought it <i>just</i> to introduce,
pending the general revision of the legislation affecting
the Jews, several amendments in the enactments concerning
their rights of residence at present in force." The amendments
were trifling: the Jews with a higher education were
permitted to live in the villages and acquire real property there,
as well as to carry on business everywhere. Those who had
participated in the Japanese war, and had distinguished them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>selves
or had conducted themselves irreproachably were to
be accorded the right of universal domicile. The wives
and under-aged children of the Jews with a higher education
were granted the right of residence even after the death
of their husbands and fathers. These rights were the only
ones which the Government thought it "just" to confer
upon the Jews, who had sent thirty thousand people into
the active army to fight on the fields of Manchuria. The
Jewish public received this niggardly gift with chilly indifference,
and turned its gaze to wider horizons which were then
opening up before Russia. The country was on the eve of a
"political spring."</p>

<p>On August 26 the post of Minister of the Interior was entrusted
to Svyatopolk-Mirski, who in his previous capacity of
governor-general of Vilna had displayed comparative administrative
leniency. The new leader of internal Russian politics
promised that he would strive for the restoration of "confidence"
between the Government and the people by adjusting
his actions to the demands of "true progress." The Jewish
deputation which waited upon him at Vilna and the representatives
of the foreign press were told that as far as the Jewish
question was concerned, he would be guided by justice and
"kindness." Unfortunately, at the very beginning he showed
himself powerless to stem the new tide of pogroms. At the
end of August, the Russian South was the scene of several
"regular" pogroms, beginning with a quarrel in a Jewish
store and ending with the demolition of Jewish stores and
houses&mdash;as was the case in the town of Smyela, in the government
of Kiev, on August 22, or in the city of Rovno, in Volhynia,
where a similar attempt was made on the same day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Soon these "regular" riots gave way to a new variety of pogroms,
which were distinguished by a peculiar coloring and
might be termed "mobilization pogroms." The mobilized Russian
reserve troops, wrought up over their impending departure
to the fields of death in Manchuria where the Russian army
suffered defeat after defeat, directed their protest along the
line of least resistance&mdash;against the Jews. The soldiers, fortifying
themselves with goodly doses of alcohol, began their
"gallant exploits," and, accompanied by the street mobs,
engaged in the task of devastating Jewish homes, maltreating
their inmates, and looting their property. A sanguinary
pogrom took place in Alexandria, in the government of Kherson,
on September 6 and 7. On the sacred day of Yom
Kippur a horde of intoxicated assassins invaded the synagogue
which was crowded with worshippers, and butchered there
twenty people in a most barbarous fashion. Among the
severely wounded, who soon afterwards died from the wounds,
were several gymnazium and university students. The police
made no attempt to stop the killing and looting, and only on
the second day, when the excesses were renewed, the Cossacks
were summoned from an adjacent town, and succeeded in
restoring order.</p>

<p>A month later, the mobilized Russian reservists began to
perpetrate a series of pogroms in the North, in the region
of White Russia. In the city of Moghilev the lawlessness of
the soldiers and the local hooligans assumed appalling dimensions
(October 10). The poorest quarters of the town suffered
most. Among the victims of the riots were also the families
of Jewish reservists who had gone to war. From the capital
of the government the pogrom epidemic spread all over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
region. Everywhere the intoxicated "crusaders," prior to
their departure for Manchuria, engaged in destruction, looting,
and incendiarism. In some places, as was the case in the government
of Vitebsk, the rioters acted with perfect religious
toleration, and even attacked the police, although the center of
the "stage" was still occupied by the Jews.</p>

<p>The Government was manifestly unwilling to adopt energetic
measures against the "defenders of the Fatherland" for fear
of irritating them still further and spoiling the progress of
mobilization. It was not until the end of October that the
mobilization pogroms died out.</p>


<h3>5. <span class="smcap">The Homel Pogrom Before the Russian Courts</span></h3>

<p>In the same month of October, 1904, the case of the Homel
pogrom of the previous year came up before the Court of
Appeals of the Government of Kiev, which held its sessions
at Homel. The department of justice had taken a whole year
to prepare the evidence, prompted by the desire not so much
to investigate the case as to entangle it and present it in a
perverted political interpretation. The investigation which
had started in the lifetime of Plehve and proceeded under the
pressure of the anti-Semitic reactionary, Minister of Justice
Muravyov, resulted in a bill of indictment which was a flagrant
example of deliberate misrepresentation. The whole affair was
pictured as an anti-Russian pogrom which had been perpetrated
by the Jews. According to this version, the Jews of Homel,
wishing to avenge the Kishinev massacre, had taken up arms
and attacked the Christian population on August 29, thereby
calling forth a counter-pogrom on the part of the Russian
workingmen on September 1, when again the armed Jewish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
self-defence had taken an aggressive attitude and thereby
forced the soldiers to shoot at them. Sixty people were indicted
on this charge, among them thirty-six Jews, representing
the part of the population which had been the victims of the
pogrom. The Jews who had dared to defend themselves stood
at the prisoners' bar side by side with their assailants. Yielding
to the pressure of public opinion, the Government decided
to have the Homel case tried in open court, but the president
of the tribunal was instructed to eliminate from the judicial
proceedings all political revelations which might embarrass
the Government. The &eacute;lite of the legal profession, both among
Jews and non-Jews (Vinaver, Sliosberg, Kalmanovich, Ratner,
Sokolov, Kupernik, Zarudny, and others), assembled at Homel
to plead the cause of the indicted Jews and to defend the action
for damages brought by the Jewish pogrom victims. The
trial was drawn out for nearly three months, reducing itself
to a duel between the counsel who endeavored to bring out
the facts, and the bench which was anxious to suppress
them. The depositions of the witnesses and the cross-examinations
of the Jewish lawyers succeeded in demolishing the
entire structure of the indictment, but when the case reached
the stage which was bound to lead to the detection of the real
authors of the pogrom and lay bare the conduct of the authorities,
the president stopped the counsel despotically, denying
them the floor. The gross partiality manifested by the president
of the court had the effect that the counsel for the defence
lost their patience, and on December 21, after a violent scene,
refused to participate in the trial and demonstratively left the
court-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>This action aroused public opinion throughout Russia to
an extraordinary degree; it caused a storm of indignation
against this official miscarriage of justice, and the fearless
defenders received innumerable expressions of sympathy. The
indicted Jews, too, joined in the noble demonstration of their
lawyers, which was in itself an eloquent plea for a righteous
cause. The trial terminated in January, 1905, and ended in
the acquittal of half of the accused Jews and Christians and
a verdict of guilty against the other half from among both
groups. The guilty were sentenced to comparatively light
penalties&mdash;to imprisonment for brief terms&mdash;and, in addition,
the court decided to petition the Tzar for a mitigation even
of these penalties.</p>

<p>This verdict displayed the Jesuitic character of Russian politics.
The reprobate murderers and plunderers from among
the Russian group were either acquitted altogether, or were
sentenced to trifling penalties and placed on the same level of
culpability with the members of the Jewish self-defence whose
only crime was that they had stood up for their life, honor,
and property. The Russian law journal <i>Pravo</i> ("The Law"),
the organ of the progressive Russian <i>intelligenzia</i>, published on
this occasion a strong article which concluded with the following
words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The truth stands out in bold relief even in this verdict, and it
does so against the wish of its authors. If, as is implied in
this verdict, both the Jews and Christians are guilty of murder,
violence, and plunder to a minimum degree only&mdash;for how could
otherwise the extraordinary leniency of the verdict be justified?&mdash;then
everybody is bound to ask himself the question: Who then
is the real author of all the horrors that were perpetrated at
Homel? Those who have followed the course of the judicial in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>vestigation
with some degree of attention can only have one
answer: Besides the Christians and the Jews, there is still a
third culprit, the politically rotten officialdom. This culprit did
not stand at the prisoners' bar, but the verdict is against him....
The best elements of the Russian public, and the Jews in particular,
have been thirsting for justice and for the disclosure of
the truth, but it was just that third accomplice who was afraid
of justice and has managed to cover it up by a general amnesty.</p></div>

<p>Such was the end of the two ill-fated years of Russian-Jewish
history (1903-1904)&mdash;years, marked by the internal
war against the Jews and by the external war against Japan,
filled with the victories of the reaction at Kishinev and Homel
and the defeats of the Russian arms at Port Arthur, Liao-Yang,
and Mukden. This ghastly interval of reactionary
terrorism, which began to subside only towards the end of
1904, drove from Russia to America more than 125,000 Jewish
emigrants who fled for their very lives from the dominions of
the Tzar.</p>

<p>However, at the end of the long nightmare, the political
horizon began to clear up. The tide of the liberty movement
surged forward again and it looked as if the Russian people,
and with it tormented Russian Jewry, would soon behold the
new dawn. Yet the six million Jews of Russia were destined
to pass through two more stormy years, standing between the
firing lines of autocratic despotism and the revolutionary movement,
and suffering the excruciating agonies of suspense, while
hovering between degradation and emancipation.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV</a><br />

THE REVOLUTION OF 1905 AND THE FIGHT FOR
EMANCIPATION</h2>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">The Jews in the Revolutionary Movement</span></h3>

<p>The "political spring," manifesting itself in the attempt of
the Government, headed by Svyatopolk-Mirski, to establish
friendly relations with the liberal elements of Russia, gave
the first impetus to an open movement for political emancipation.
The liberal "conspirators," who had hitherto been
secretly dreaming of a constitution, gave public utterance to
this tabooed aspiration. In November, 1904, the conference
of Zemstvo workers, assembled in St. Petersburg, adopted a
resolution pointing out "the anomaly of the political order"
of Russia which is founded on autocracy and proclaiming the
necessity of associating the representatives of the people in
the work of legislation. About the same time, a large mass-meeting,
which took the form of a public banquet, attended by
lawyers and litt&eacute;rateurs, adopted a similar resolution calling
for "the repeal of all national and denominational restrictions."
Taking advantage of the temporary relaxation of
police despotism, the press spoke up more boldly, while the
better elements of the population began to organize themselves
in all kinds of public bodies.</p>

<p>The Government was slow in making concessions, and
harshly condemned the "boisterous assemblages" which called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
for changes in "the unshakable foundations of our political
order." Nevertheless, an imperial ukase, published on December
12, 1904, promised a number of partial reforms&mdash;improvement
of the legal status of the peasantry, enlargement of the
activities of the Zemstvos, the establishment of a state insurance
for workingmen, relaxation of the severities of police
and censorship, and likewise "a revision of the laws restricting
the rights of aliens," with the retention of those provisions
only "which are called forth by the genuine interests of the
state and the manifest needs of the Russian people." It is
almost needless to add that the latter clause held forth no
promises to the Jews. For their disfranchisement could always
be justified by "the genuine interests of the state"&mdash;a state
built upon the foundations not of law, but of police force.
The carrying into effect of the promised semi-reforms was
entrusted to a bureaucratic body, the Committee of Ministers.
The services of the popular representatives were repudiated.</p>

<p>The new movement for liberty forced further concessions
from Russian officialdom, but these concessions could only be
wrested from it in small doses and were granted only after
a desperate resistance. The "bloody Sunday" of January 9,
1905, marked the beginning of the open revolution in which
social, economic, and political demands were interwoven with
one another. The demonstration of the striking workingmen
of St. Petersburg, who marched in immense numbers to the
Winter Palace to present a petition to the Tzar for economic
and political reforms, ended in a tragedy. The petitioners
who marched with crosses in their hands, under the leadership
of the priest and demagogue Gapon, were received with
a shower of bullets, resulting in a large number of victims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
from among the participants in the demonstration, as well as
from among the public. There were also several Jews among
them&mdash;a first-aid nurse, a dentist, a pharmacy student and a
journalist. This scandalous conduct of the Tzar, who replied
with bullets to a peaceful appeal for reforms, led to a series
of demonstrations, labor strikes, and terrorist acts in the
provinces.</p>

<p>In the Western governments and in the Kingdom of Poland
the Jews played a conspicuous r&ocirc;le in the revolutionary movement,
counting as they did a large number of organized workingmen.
In Odessa, a Jewish workingman by the name of
Stillman fired at the Chief of Police and wounded him
(January 19). In Moghilev, a Jewish youth made a vain
attempt upon the life of the local Chief of Police who was accused
of having instigated the pogrom which had taken place
there in the fall of 1904. These incidents served in the hands
of the reactionary Government&mdash;on January 9, Svyatopolk-Mirski
had been dismissed for his excessive leaning toward
liberalism&mdash;as an excuse for continuing its oppression of the
Jews as the "ringleaders of the revolution." The president of
the Committee of Ministers, Witte, was the only one who advocated
a different point of view. At the meeting of the Committee,
held on February 11, he contended that "the hostile
attitude toward the Government, now noticeable among the
Jews, is due to the sad material conditions in which the bulk of
Russian Jewry lives, being weighed down by the pressure of
restrictive laws." Witte prophesied that the police authorities
would be bound "to fight with redoubled zeal against the anti-governmental
activity of the Jews, until the amelioration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
condition of the aliens, promised in the ukase of December 12,
would be carried into effect."</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The Struggle for Equal Rights</span></h3>

<p>Notwithstanding these pleas, the Government was slow in
realizing even the moderate reforms which had been outlined
in the imperial ukase. In the meantime the representatives
of Russian Jewry had decided to place before it their own more
comprehensive demands. In February, 1905, several mass petitions,
demanding equal rights for Jews, were addressed to
Witte. A petition signed by thirty-two Jewish communities&mdash;St.
Petersburg, Vilna, Kovno, Homel, Berdychev, and others&mdash;began
with these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The measures adopted for the last twenty-five years toward the
Russian Jews were designed with the deliberate end in view to
convert them into a mass of beggars, deprived of all means of
sustenance, and of the light of education and human dignity.
Consistency and comprehensiveness marked the system of oppression
and violence which was skilfully planned and carefully
executed.... The entire machinery of the state was directed to
one end&mdash;that of making the life of the Jews in Russia impossible.</p></div>

<p>The petition repudiates the idea, voiced in the ukase of
December 12, 1904, of a gradual amelioration of the position
of the Jews, and of a few "mitigations"; for "the insulted
dignity of man cannot be reconciled to half measures; it demands
the complete removal of rightlessness."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All the Jews of Russia are permeated at the present moment by
one thought: that the cruel system of endless restrictions and
disabilities undermines the very basis of their existence, that it is
impossible to continue such a life.... Worn out by all they have
had to go through, and filled with grave anxiety about their future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
destinies, the Jews are waiting at last for their entire enfranchisement;
they are waiting for a radical repeal of all restrictive laws,
so that, enjoying freedom and equality with all others, they may,
shoulder to shoulder with the other citizens of this great country,
work for its welfare and prosperity.</p></div>

<p>A memorandum couched in more resolute terms was sent
by twenty-six Jewish communities&mdash;Moscow, Odessa, and
others&mdash;and by the radical groups of the communities which
had signed the first petition.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We declare&mdash;the memorandum states&mdash;that we look upon the attempt
to satisfy and appease the Jewish population by any partial
measures of improvement as doomed to failure. We expect equal
rights, as human beings in whom the feeling of human dignity is
alive, as conscious citizens in a modern body politic.</p></div>

<p>The memorandum of the Vilna community made the following
addition to the last clause: "As a cultured nation,
we demand the same rights of national-cultural self-determination
which ought to be granted to all the nationalities that
go to make up the Russian body politic."</p>

<p>Memorials and telegrams, addressed to the president of the
Committee of Ministers, with the demand for equal rights,
were also sent by many individual Jewish communities.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the general revolutionary movement in
Russia proceeded apace. Professional organizations were
springing into existence, such as the leagues of railroad
workers, engineers, and lawyers. Here and there, huge railroad
strikes were called. The college youth were in a state of
ferment, and often went on strike. The agitation was answered
by rifle shots and Cossack whips which were used to disperse
the demonstrators. The extreme wing of the Socialist party
resorted to terroristic acts. A tremendous sensation was caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
by the assassination of Grand Duke Sergius, the governor-general
of Moscow (February 4), one of the most detestable
members of the house of Romanov. The grand duke, whose
name was bound up with the expulsion of tens of thousands of
Jews from Moscow in 1891 and with the cruel oppression of
the Jewish colony still left there, was the victim of a bomb
thrown by a non-Jew, the Social-Revolutionist Kalayev.</p>

<p>The surging tide of the revolution intimidated Nicholas II.,
and wrested from him still another concession. On February
18, 1905, three enactments were published: an imperial manifesto
condemning the revolutionary "unrest" at a time when
"the sanguinary war in the Far East" was going on, and calling
upon all "well-intentioned persons" to wage war against
"the internal sedition." A rescript addressed to Bulyghin,
Minister of the Interior, announced the decision of the Tzar "to
invite the worthiest men, invested with the confidence of the
nation and chosen by the population, to participate in the
consideration of legislative projects"&mdash;in other words, a popular
representation with merely consultative rights. Finally, an
ukase addressed to the Senate granted permission to private
persons and institutions to lay before the Government their
"views and suggestions relating to the perfection of the wellbeing
of the state."</p>

<p>The progressive elements of Russia were not in a mood to
be reconciled to the duplicity of these enactments in which
threats and concessions followed upon one another, or to the
pettiness of the concessions in themselves. They took, however,
full advantage of the permission to "lay" their views
before the Government, and indulged in an avalanche of resolutions
and declarations, demanding the substitution of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
parliamentary system of government for the existing system of
autocracy. The Jewish institutions joined in this general
campaign. The oldest Jewish organization, the "Society for
the Diffusion of Enlightenment Among the Jews," in St.
Petersburg, at a meeting, held on February 27, adopted the
following resolution:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The proper organization of Jewish education such as would be in
keeping with the social and cultural peculiarities of the Jewish
people, will only be possible when the Jews will be placed on a
footing of complete equality of rights with the rest of the Russian
population. As a firm guarantee of the untrammelled cultural
development and the complete equality of all nationalities, it is
necessary that the legislative power and the administrative control
of the country shall have the co-operation of popular representatives,
to be elected upon the basis of the universal, direct, and
secret vote of all citizens of the country, without any distinction
of nationality, denomination or calling.</p></div>

<p>The need of a non-partisan political organization to direct
the struggle for Jewish emancipation which was to be waged
by all classes of Jewry&mdash;outside the small fraction which
had already been united in the labor organization of the
"Bund"&mdash;was universally felt.</p>

<p>Such an organization was formed at the conference of public-spirited
Jews which took place in Vilna at the end of March,
1905. It assumed the name of "The League for the Attainment
of Equal Rights for the Jewish People in Russia," and
proclaimed as its object "the realization to their full extent
of the <i>civil, political, and national rights</i> of the Jewish people
in Russia." The complete civil emancipation of the Jews, the
assurance of their proportionate participation in the Russian
popular representation, "the freedom of national-cultural self<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>-determination
in all its manifestations," in the shape of "a
comprehensive system of communal self-government, the freedom
of language and school education"&mdash;such was the threefold
program of the League.</p>

<p>It was the first attempt of a Jewish organization in modern
history to inscribe upon its banner not only the demand for
the civil and political, but also for the national emancipation
of the Jewish people, the first attempt to obtain liberty for
Jewry as a nationality, and not as a mere denominational
group, forming part of the dominant nation, as had been the
case in Western Europe during the nineteenth century. The
central bureau of the League was located in St. Petersburg,
composed of twenty-two elective members, half of whom lived
in the capital (M. Vinaver, G. Sliosberg, L. Bramson, and
others), and the other half in the provinces (Dr. Shmaryahu
Levin, S. M. Dubnow,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> M. Ratner, and others).</p>

<p>The first resolutions adopted by the League were in substance
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To demand universal suffrage at the elections to the future
parliament, with a guarantee of proper representation for the
national minorities; to influence the Russian public to the end that
the general resolutions demanding equality for all citizens should
contain an explicit reference to the emancipation of the Jews;
to call upon all the Jewish aldermen in the municipal Dumas to
resign their posts, in view of the fact that under the law of 1892,
which had deprived the Jews of their franchise at the municipal
elections,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> these aldermen had not been elected by the Jewish
population, but had been appointed by the administration&mdash;an
act which implied an insult to the civic and national dignity of
the Jewish people.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>The last-mentioned clause of this resolution, adopted at the
first conference of the League, proved effective. In the majority
of cities, the Jewish members of the municipal Dumas
began to tender their resignations, by way of protest against
the disfranchisement of the Jews in the municipal self-government.
At first, the authorities were somewhat embarrassed and
made an attempt to appoint other Jews in lieu of those that
had resigned, but seeing that the Jewish boycott continued,
they became "reconciled" to the entire absence of Jewish
representatives in municipal self-government. The protest of
the Jewish aldermen was drowned in the general noise of protests
and demonstrations which filled the air during the revolutionary
year.</p>


<h3>3. <span class="smcap">The "Black Hundred" and the "Patriotic"
Pogroms</span></h3>

<p>In this wise did the Jewish people, though chafing under
thraldom and well-nigh crushed by it, strive for the light of
liberty. But the forces of reaction were preparing to wreak
terrible vengeance upon the prisoner for his endeavor to throw
off his bonds. As the revolutionary tide, which had engulfed
the best elements of the Russian people, was rolling on, it
clashed with the filthy wave of the Black Hundred, which
the underlings of Tzardom had called to the surface from
the lowest depths of the Russian underworld. <i>Acheronta
movebo</i><a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>&mdash;this threat was now carried out systematically
by the Government of Nicholas II. in its struggle with the
emancipatory movement. By letting loose the Russian
"nether-world" against the liberal <i>intelligentzia</i> and the Zhyds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the reactionaries hoped to achieve three objects at once: to
intimidate the liberals and revolutionaries; to demonstrate
the unwillingness of the "people" to abolish autocracy in
favor of constitutional government, and, finally, to discredit the
entire revolutionary movement as "the work of Jewish hands."
The latter end could, in the opinion of the reactionaries, be
obtained best by convincing the Russian masses that "the
enemies of Christ are the only enemies of the Tzar." An
open anti-Jewish agitation was set in motion. Proclamations
of the Black Hundred with the appeals, "Slay the students and
the Zhyds!" "Remember Kishinev and Homel!" were scattered
broadcast. The proclamation of the "Nationalist Society"
of Kiev, Odessa, Kishinev, and other cities contained
the following sentences:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The shouts "Down with autocracy!" are the shouts of those
blood-suckers who call themselves Zhyds, Armenians, and
Poles.... Be on your guard against the Zhyds! All the misfortunes
in our lives are due to the Zhyds. Soon, very soon, the
great time will come when there will be no Zhyds in Russia.
Down with the traitors! Down with the constitution!</p></div>

<p>With the approaching Passover season, pogroms were openly
organized. The papers were flooded with telegrams from many
cities stating that riots were imminent. In some places the
governors adopted measures to check the excesses of the savage
crowd, but in many localities the pogroms were deliberately
permitted or even directly engineered by the police. In the
manufacturing city of Bialystok, the center of the Jewish
labor movement, the Cossacks assaulted Jewish passers-by on
the streets, invaded the synagogues and Jewish homes, cruelly
maltreating their inmates and frequently searching them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
taking away their money (April 9-10). During the Passover
holidays, peasants made an attack upon the Jews in the town
of Dusyaty, in the government of Kovno, looting their property
and beating those that dared to oppose them. In the city of
Melitopol, in the government of Tavrida, an intoxicated mob
demolished and set fire to Jewish stores, and thereupon started
to attack the houses of Christians, but the self-defence consisting
of Jewish and Christian young men checked the pogrom
(April 18-19). In Simferopol, in the same government,
the Black Hundred spread a rumor that a Jewish boy, the son
of a pharmacist, had desecrated a Christian ikon. A pogrom
was set in motion which met with the resistance of the armed
Jewish youth and was afterwards checked by the troops
(April 22).</p>

<p>The most terrible outbreak took place in Zhitomir. In this
quiet center of Volhynia the progressive elements of both the
Jewish and the Russian population revelled in the joy of their
political honeymoon. As had been the case in other large cities,
here, too, the "bloody Sunday" of January called forth political
strikes on the part of the workingmen, demonstrations on
the part of the college youth, and the circulation of revolutionary
appeals. The fact that the movement was headed by the
Jewish youth was enough to inspire the Black Hundred to
embark upon their criminal task. All kinds of rumors were
set afloat, such as that the Jews had been firing at the Tzar's
portrait on the field behind the city, that they were preparing
to slaughter the Christians, and other absurd stories. At
the approach of Passover, the pogrom organizers summoned
to their aid a group of "Katzaps," Great-Russian laborers,
from Moscow. The Jews, anticipating the danger, began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
arm themselves in self-defence, and made their preparations
openly. A clash between the "Black" and the "Red" was
inevitable. It came in the form of a sanguinary battle which
was fought on April 23-26, matching by its cruelty the
pogrom at Homel, though exceeding it vastly by its dimensions.</p>

<p>In the course of three days, the city was in the hands of
the black hordes who plundered, murdered and mutilated the
Jews. They were fortified not only by quantities of alcohol,
but also by the conviction that they were fighting for the Tzar
against the "Sicilists,"<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> who clamored for "freedom" and a
"republic." The Jewish self-defence performed prodigies of
valor wherever they were not interfered with by the police and
military, and died gallantly where the authorities actively assisted
the savage work of the infuriated rioters. During the
three pogrom days fifteen Jews were killed and nearly one
hundred wounded, many of them severely. The casualties
were mostly among young workingmen and handicraftsmen.
But there were also some students among the victims, one of
them a Christian, named Blinov, who stood up nobly for the assaulted
Jews. The inhuman fiends fell upon Blinov, shouting:
"Though you are a Russian, you are a Sicilist and worse than
the Zhyds, now that you've come to defend them." The young
hero was beaten to death, and the murderers were actively
assisted by soldiers and policemen.</p>

<p>On one of those days, on April 25, a heart-rending tragedy
took place in the town of Troyanov, in the government of
Volhynia, not far from Zhitomir. Having learned of the massacre
that was going on in Zhitomir, fourteen brave Jewish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
young men from the neighboring town of Chudnov armed
themselves with cheap pistols, and proceeded to bring aid to
their endangered fellow-Jews. On the way, while passing
through Troyanov, they were met by a crowd of peasants and
workingmen who had been aroused by a rumor that Jewish
"slaughterers" were marching in order to exterminate the
Russians. The infuriated mob fell upon the youths, and, in
the presence of the local Jews, savagely killed ten of them,
while the others were cruelly beaten. The following account
of this ghastly occurrence was given by one of the survivors:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There were fourteen of us. We were on the way from Chudnov
to Zhitomir. In Troyanov we were surrounded by Katzaps. They
began to search us, taking away everything we had, and then
started to beat us with hatchets and clubs. I saw my comrades
fall down dead one after the other. Before the constabulary appeared,
only four had remained alive, I and three other men. The
constabulary ordered us to be carried to the hospital at Zhitomir,
but on the way we were wrested by the Katzaps from the rural
police and were tortured again.... I was roped and dragged
to the priest. He begged that I should be left alone. The Katzaps
made fun of him, dragged me out again, and started to beat me.
The policemen began to tell them that "they would answer for
me," since the constabulary had ordered them to get me to Zhitomir.
"Well," said the Katzaps, "if that be the case, we will let
him go, but before we do this, that hound of a Jew must have a
look at his fellow-Zhyds." I was then dragged in an unconscious
state to my comrades. I found myself in a pool of water. I had
been drenched so as to make me regain consciousness. Then I
beheld the dead bodies of my ten comrades.... No matter how
long I may live, I shall never forget that sight.... One of them
lay with his head chopped off; another with a ripped stomach ...
cut off hands.... I fell into a swoon, and found myself here in
this bed.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>In the cemetery of Troyanov one may still behold the ten
graves of the youthful martyrs who unselfishly went to the
rescue of their brethren against beasts in human form, and
were on the way torn to pieces by these beasts&mdash;ten graves
which ought to become sacred to the entire Jewish people.</p>

<p>The Government reacted upon the Zhitomir massacre by an
official communication in which the facts were deliberately
garbled in order to prove that the Jews had called forth the
pogrom by their conduct. It was alleged in this communication
that, during their shooting exercises in the woods, the Jews
had discharged their pistols at the portrait of the Tzar, had
hurled insulting remarks at the police escort which was
conveying a band of political prisoners, had issued a proclamation
in the name of "the criminal party of the Social-Revolutionaries"
in which the authorities of Zhitomir were
accused of preparing the pogrom, and similar charges. The
concrete object of the official communication is betrayed
in its concluding part in which the governors are enjoined
"to explain to the sober-minded section of the Jewish population
that, in the interest of the safety of the Jewish masses,
it is in duty bound to inspire their coreligionists who
have been drawn into the political struggle with the consciousness
of the absolute necessity of refraining from arousing by
their behavior the hatred of the Christian population against
them." Translated into plain terms, the Government order
meant: "If you do not wish to have pogroms and massacres,
then keep your hands off the liberty movement; but if you
will persist in playing a part in it, then the Christian population
will make short work of you, dealing with you as with
enemies of the Fatherland."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Caught in the general revolutionary conflagration which
flared up with particular violence in the summer of 1905, after
the destruction of the Russian fleet by the Japanese near
Tsushima, the Jews reacted upon the pogroms by intensifying
their revolutionary activity and swelling the number of self-defence
organizations. Russian Jewry played an active part
in the two wings of the emancipation army, the Constitutional-Democratic
as well as the Social-Democratic party, and was
represented even in the extreme wing occupied by the Social-Revolutionaries.
The majority of these Jewish revolutionaries
were actuated by general Russian aspirations, and were often
entirely oblivious of the national interests of Judaism. This,
however, did not prevent the henchmen of the Tzar from visiting
the "sin" of the revolution upon the Jewish masses. A
vicious circle was the result of this policy: As victims of the
old despotism, the Jews naturally threw in their lot with the
revolution which promised to do away with it; thereupon uncivilized
Russia vented its fury upon them by instituting pogroms
which, in turn, pushed them more and more into the
ranks of the revolution.</p>

<p>During the summer months of 1905, a new succession of
pogroms took place, this time of the military variety. Wrought
up over the defeats of the Russian army in Manchuria, and
roused by the vile proclamations of the Black Hundred which
pictured the Jews as the inner enemy, soldiers and Cossacks
began to wreak their vengeance upon this inner enemy, assaulting
and killing or wounding Jews on the streets of Minsk
(May 26), Brest-Litovsk (May 29-31), Syedletz and Lodz
(June 9). In the first three cities, the soldiers plundered and
murdered only the Jews. In Lodz, they fired at a mixed Polish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>-Jewish
demonstration of workingmen. A regular butchery was
engineered by the soldiery in Bialystok (June 30). During
the entire day, the city resounded with the rifle shots of maddened
soldiers who were firing into peaceful Jewish crowds.
Fifty dead and a still larger number of wounded were the
result of these military exploits.</p>

<p>During the same time a regularly organized pogrom occurred
in the southern outskirts of Russia, in the city of Kerch,
in the Crimea. On July 27, a peaceful political demonstration
of the kind then generally in vogue took place in that
city; among the participants were also the Jewish youth. By
way of protest, the city-governor and gendarmerie chief
organized a "patriotic" counter-demonstration, which was
held a few days later, on July 31. Carrying a banner with the
portrait of the Tzar and singing the Russian national hymn,
the "patriotic" hordes, with the notorious local thieves and
hooligans as the predominating element, sacked Jewish houses
and stores, and, in the name of patriotism, looted Jewish property&mdash;even
the so-called respectable public participating in the
latter act. When the armed Jewish self-defence began to
oppose the rioters, they were scattered by a volley from the
soldiers, ten of them being killed on the spot. The subsequent
inquiry established the fact that the pogrom had been
fully prepared by the police and gendarmerie authorities, which
had been in telegraphic communication in regard to it with
the Police Department in St. Petersburg. It was a rehearsal
of the monstrous October pogroms which were to take place a
few months later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>


<h3>4. <span class="smcap">The Jewish Franchise</span></h3>

<p>In the midst of the noise caused by the revolution on the
one hand and by the pogroms on the other, the question of
popular representation, promised in the ukase of February
18, 1905, was discussed in the highest Government spheres of
Russia. A committee, which met under the chairmanship of
M. Bulyghin, was drafting a scheme of a consultative popular
assembly; as far as the Jews were concerned, it was proposed
to exclude them from the franchise, on the ground that the
latter would not be compatible with their civil disfranchisement.
This proposition, which was in entire accord with
the general reactionary trend of Russian politics, called
forth a storm of indignation in all circles of Russian Jewry.
During the month of June protest resolutions against the
contemplated measure were adopted by the Jewish communities
of St. Petersburg, Riga, Kishinev, Bobruisk, Zhitomir,
Nicholayev, Minsk, Vitebsk, Vilna, and other cities.
Many resolutions were couched in violent terms betraying
the outraged sentiments of Russian Jewry. As an illustration,
the following extract from the Vilna resolution may be quoted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the proposed scheme of popular representation, we Jews, a
cultured nation of six millions, are placed below the semi-savage
aliens of Eastern Russia. The policy of pacification applied to
other suppressed nationalities has given way to a policy of terrorization
when the Jews are concerned. The mad system, consisting
in the endeavor to irritate and infuriate the Jews by medi&aelig;val
persecutions and thereupon wreak vengeance on them for the
manifestation of that irritation, has now reached its climax....
We appeal to the Russian people, which is now called upon to
renovate the antiquated political structure of the country....
We are of the hope that the malign vindictiveness toward the Jews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
on the part of the retiring bureaucracy, which is eager to carry over
the ferments of corruption into the healthy atmosphere of the
future popular representation, will not be realized.</p></div>

<p>Professor Trubetzkoy, who waited upon the Tzar on June 6,
at the head of a combined deputation of Zemstvos and
municipalities, pointed out in his famous speech that no one
should be excluded from popular representation: "It is important
that there should not be any disfranchised and disinherited."
The Government was shaken in its resolution, and
the Council of Ministers eliminated from the Bulyghin project
the clause barring the Jews from voting, justifying this step
by the undesirability "to irritate the Jews still further."</p>

<p>The Jewish question was also touched upon in the conferences
at Peterhof, which were held during the month of July
under the chairmanship of the Tzar, to formulate plans for
an Imperial Duma. Naryshkin, a reactionary dignitary,
demanded that "the dangerous Jewish nation" be barred from
the Duma. But a number of other dignitaries&mdash;the Minister
of Finance, Kokovtzev, the Assistant-Minister of the Interior,
Trepov, and Obolenski and Chikhachev, members of the
Council of State&mdash;advocated their admission, and the discussions
were terminated by the brief remark of the Tzar: "The
project [with the insertion of the Council of Ministers in
favor of the Jews] shall be left unaltered."</p>

<p>By this action, the Government made itself guilty of a
flagrant inconsistency. It conferred upon the Jews the
highest political privilege&mdash;the right of voting for popular
representatives&mdash;but left them at the same time in a state of
complete civil disfranchisement, even with regard to such
elementary liberties as the right of domicile, the right of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
transit, and so on. Only one month previously, on June 8, the
Tzar had approved the "Opinion" of the Committee of
Ministers&mdash;in pursuance of the ukase of December 12, 1904,
the Committee had been busy discussing the Jewish problem&mdash;to
the effect that the consideration of the question of ameliorating
the condition of the Jews should be deferred until the
convocation of the new Parliament. Evidently, the anti-Jewish
conscience of the Tzar made it impossible for him to
grant even the slightest relief to the Jews who from pariahs
had been turned into revolutionaries.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI</a><br />

THE COUNTER-REVOLUTION AND THE OCTOBER
MASSACRES</h2>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">The Fiendish Designs of the "Black Hundred"</span></h3>

<p>Soon afterwards, on August 6, 1905, the so-called "Bulyghin
Constitution" was made public, providing for a truncated
Imperial Duma with a system of representation based on class
qualifications and limited to advisory functions but without
any restrictions as far as the franchise of the Jews was concerned.
"Now," wrote the <i>Voskhod</i>, "the Jew has the
right to be a popular representative, but he has no right to
reside in the place in which the Imperial Duma assembles&mdash;in
the capital." Russian Jewry, with the exception of its
Left wing, was on the point of starting an election campaign
to send its representatives to this mutilated Duma,
in the hope of attaining through it to a more perfect form
of representation, when the stormy course of events brought
to the fore new threatening questions. This counterfeit of a
national parliament failed to satisfy the Russian democracy,
and the struggle with the Government broke out anew with
unprecedented energy. Stormy political meetings were held at
the universities and at the other institutions of higher learning,
which, by an ukase of August 27, had been granted academic
self-government. The autonomous professorial councils
began to admit Jewish students to the schools, without any restrictive
percentage, and the wave of an agitated Jewish youth
was drawn into the whirling sea of the Russian student body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
A new succession of strikes followed, arranged by the students,
workingmen and railroad workers. A general Russian
strike was being carefully prepared as a last resort in the
struggle for a democratic constitution. The army of the
emancipation movement was instituting a bloodless revolution,
the temporary stoppage of all railroad movements and of all
other activities in the country, in the hope of forcing Tzardom
to an act of self-abnegation and the proclamation of civil
liberties.</p>

<p>The month of September and the beginning of October were
spent in these feverish preparations, but at the same time, the
black army of absolutism was making its own arrangements for
a sanguinary counter-revolution, for regular St. Bartholomew
nights, directed against the participants in the emancipation
movement, and particularly against the Jews. The plans of
the emancipation army were universally known, but the terrible
designs of the dark forces of reaction were effectively concealed.
Only when the bloody undertaking was accomplished, was it
possible to uncover the threads of the criminal pogrom organization,
which led from the palaces of the Tzar and the highest
dignitaries of state, by way of the Police Department, to the
slums of murderers and hooligans. In the disclosures made by
Lvov, in November, 1905, in his memorandum to Witte, the
president of the Council of Ministers, the officials in the immediate
environment of Nicholas II. who had organized the
October pogroms were pointed out by name. They were the
"patriotic" General Bogdanovich in St. Petersburg, who acted
with the blessing of Archbishop<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Vladimir and with the assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
of the Imperial camarilla and of many governors and
governors-general in the provinces. During the month of September
"fighting contingents" of the Black Hundred, whose
number, as Bogdanovich boasted in the highest government
spheres, amounted to one hundred thousand, were organized
all over Russia. In every city the parts to be enacted by the administrators,
the police and the pogrom hirelings from among
the local riff-raff were carefully prepared and assigned. The pogrom
proclamations were printed openly; the "manufacturing"
center of this propaganda literature, as was afterwards
disclosed in the Imperial Duma by deputy Urussov (formerly
Assistant-Minister of the Interior), was located in the printing
office of the Police Department. There can be no question that
the Tzar was acquainted, if not with all the details of these
preparations, at least with the general plan of arranging a
counter-revolution by means of carefully engineered massacres
of which the Jews were to become the chief victims. Millions
of rubles for the organization of the pogroms were appropriated
from a secret ten-million ruble fund, the disposition of
which lay entirely in the hands of the Tzar.</p>

<p>Such were the conditions which ushered in the month of
October, 1905. The first days of the month saw the beginning
of the railroad strike; by the middle of the month it had
already seized the entire country, accompanied in the industrial
centers by a general strike in all lines of productive endeavor.
In many cities, collisions took place between the revolutionaries
and the military. At first, the Government made an attempt
to resort to threats, and all over Russia rang the blood-thirsty
cry of the Chief of Police Trepov: "No cartridges shall be
spared!" But at the last moment, autocracy recoiled before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the revolutionary tempest and gave way. On October 17, an
imperial manifesto was issued, solemnly promising to bestow
all civil liberties upon the Russian people&mdash;inviolability of
person, freedom of conscience, liberty of speech, assemblage and
organization, and a legislative Duma in which the representatives
of all classes of the population were to have a voice. The
manifesto made no mention, however, of the equality of all
citizens before the law or of the bestowal of equal rights on
the various nationalities, and even in the accompanying memorandum
of Premier Witte, the author of the enactment of
October 17, the subject was disposed of in a few nebulous
phrases.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, even in this hazy form, the manifesto made a
tremendous impression. Everybody believed that autocratic
Tzardom had been vanquished by the army of liberty and that
Russia had been finally converted from a state founded on
police force into a body politic based on law. But, on the day
following, all these hopes were cruelly shattered. On October
18, in hundreds of cities the carefully concealed army of
counter-revolutionaries, evidently obeying a prearranged signal,
crawled out from beneath the ground, to indulge in an
orgy of blood, lasting a full week (October 18-25), which in
its horrors finds no parallel in the entire history of humanity.</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The Russian St. Bartholomew Night</span></h3>

<p>The principal victims of this protracted St. Bartholomew
night were the new Huguenots of the emancipation movement&mdash;the
Jews. They were to pay the penalty for having
assisted in wresting from the despotic Government the manifesto
with its promise of liberties. In the course of one week,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
nearly fifty anti-Jewish pogroms, accompanied by bloodshed,
took place in various cities (Odessa, Kiev, Kishinev, Kalarash,
Simferopol, Romny, Kremenchug, Chernigov, Nicholayev,
Yekaterinoslav, Kamenetz-Podolsk, Yelisavetgrad, Orsha,
etc.), in addition to several hundred "bloodless" pogroms,
marked in regular fashion by the destruction of property,
plunder, and incendiarism. The pogroms directed against the
Christian participants in the emancipation movement, such
as intellectuals, students, etc., in Tver, Tomsk, and other
interior Russian cities, amounted in all to a score or two. This
disproportion alone shows the direction in which the organized
dark forces were active. The strict uniformity and consistency
in the carrying out of the counter-revolutionary conspiracy was
too palpable to be overlooked.</p>

<p>The customary procedure was as follows: In connection
with the manifesto of October 17, the progressive elements
would arrange a street procession, frequently adorned by the
red flags of the left parties and accompanied by appropriate
acclamations and speeches expressive of the new liberty.
Simultaneously, the participants in the "patriotic demonstration"&mdash;consisting
mostly of the scum of society, of detectives
and police officials in plain clothes&mdash;would emerge from their
nooks and crannies, carrying the portrait of the Tzar under the
shadow of the national flag, singing the national hymn and
shouting, "Hurrah, beat the Zhyds! The Zhyds are eager for
liberty. They go against our Tzar to put a Zhyd in his place."
These "patriotic" demonstrators would be accompanied by
police and Cossack patrols (or soldiers), ostensibly to preserve
order, but in reality to enable the hooligans to attack and
maltreat the Jews and prevent the victims from defending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
themselves. As soon as the Jews assembled for self-defence,
they would be driven off by the police and troops. Thereupon,
the "patriotic" demonstrators and the accomplices, joining
them on the way, would break up into small bands and disperse
all over the city, invading Jewish houses and stores, ruin,
plunder, beat, and sometimes slaughter entire families.</p>

<p>The most terrible pogrom took place in Odessa. It lasted
fully four days. The rioters were openly assisted by the police
and troops, and were encouraged by the active support of city-governor
Neidthart, and the criminal inactivity of the military
governor, Kaulbars. The heroism displayed by the Jewish
self-defence was strong enough to beat off the hooligans, but it
was powerless to defeat the troops and police. Over three
hundred dead, thousands of wounded or crippled Jews, among
them many who lost their minds from the horrors, one hundred
and forty widows, five hundred and ninety-three orphans,
and more than forty thousand Jews materially ruined&mdash;such
were the results of the battle which was fought against the Jews
of Odessa during October 18-21.</p>

<p>Approximately along the same lines the pogrom campaign
was conducted in scores of other cities, with a few lurid
departures from the customary ritual, as, for instance, in
Nyezhin, in the government of Chernigov, where the Jewish
community, headed by the rabbi, was forced by the rioters,
under the pain of death, to pronounce publicly the oath of
allegiance to the Tzar. As a rule the pogroms which occurred
in hundreds of cities, towns, and villages, were limited to the
destruction of property, although even in small localities, such
as in Semyonovka, in the government of Chernigov, the riots
were occasionally accompanied by massacres. It may be added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
that the outbreaks were not confined to the Pale of Settlement.
In a number of cities outside the Pale, such as in Saratov,
Voronyezh, and other places with a small Jewish population,
the Jewish communities were ruthlessly attacked.</p>

<p>Contemporary history is not yet in a position to depict all the
horrors which were perpetrated upon the Jews in Russia in
the latter half of October, 1905, or to trace with any amount
of accuracy their underlying causes. Let us draw a veil over
this bloody spectacle. There will come a time when the world
will shudder on learning the truth about the bloody happenings
and about the real culprits of this prolonged Bartholomew
night at the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>The sinister counter-revolution which broke out on October
17, the day on which the manifesto of the Tzar was promulgated,
threatened to drag the revolution into the abyss of anarchy.
All were profoundly aroused by the perfidious Byzantine policy
of Nicholas II., who with one hand waved the peace banner
before the progressive section of the Russian people, and with
the other plunged a knife into its heart&mdash;a knife which most
of all was to slash Jewry. Not only the parties of the extreme
Left, but even the Constitutionalists who were willing to accept
the promises of the October manifesto, had little faith in their
ultimate realization. A reign of chaos ensued. The parties of
the Left demanded now a democratic, now even a social, republic.
The political and labor strikes, among them those arranged
by the Jewish "Bund," assumed the character of anarchy. The
peasant or agrarian movement burst forth, accompanied by the
burning of manors and estates. Poland and the Baltic region
were in the throes of terrorism. Moscow witnessed an armed
uprising with barricades and with all the paraphernalia of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
popular revolution (December, 1905). The Government
quelled the Moscow rebellion, and resolutely adopted a policy
of repression. Arrests, executions, punitive military expeditions,
were the means by which the program of the Witte-Durnovo
Cabinet was to be carried into effect.</p>

<p>The reactionary camarilla around the Tzar operated in full
force, fanning the hatred against the Jews. On December 23,
the Tzar received a deputation of the ringleaders of the Black
Hundred, who had organized themselves in the "League of the
Russian People." One of the speeches appealing to the Tzar
to preserve autocracy was devoted to the Jewish question. The
deputation begged the Tzar "not to give equal rights to the
Jews." To this Nicholas replied laconically: "I shall think
it over."</p>


<h3>3. <span class="smcap">The Undaunted Struggle for Equal Rights</span></h3>

<p>The terrible October calamities were faced by Russian Jewry
in a spirit of courage and fortitude. It stood alone in its
sorrow. The progressive elements of Russian society which
were themselves in the throes of a great crisis reacted feebly
upon the sufferings of the Jewish people which had become
the scape-goat of the counter-revolution. The indifference of
the outside world, however, was counteracted by the rise of the
Jewish national sentiment among the better classes of Russian
Jewry. One month after the pogrom bacchanalia, the "League
for the Attainment of Equal Rights for the Jewish People"
held its second convention in St. Petersburg. The Convention
which lasted four days (November 22-25) gave public utterance
to the feeling of profound national indignation. It voted
down the motion to send a deputation to Count Witte, asking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
for the immediate grant of equal rights to the Jews. In the
resolution repudiating this step the policy of the Government
was characterized in these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The facts have incontrovertibly proved that the recent pogroms,
appalling by their dimensions and by the number of their victims,
have been staged with the open connivance and, in many cases,
with the immediate assistance and sometimes even under the
direction of the police and highest local administration; that the
Government, not at all abashed by the monstrous crimes of its
executive organs, the local representatives of State authority,
has not removed from office a single one of the suspected functionaries,
and has taken no measures to bring them to justice.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that Count Witte has repeatedly stated that
the Government does not see its way clear to proclaim at the
present moment the emancipation of the Jews, supposedly in the
interest of the Jews themselves, against whom the agitation of
the popular masses might be intensified by such a measure,
whereas, in reality, the pogroms are a result of that very rightlessness
of the Jews which is fully realized by the masses of the
Russian people and by the so-called Black Hundred&mdash;the Convention
resolves that the sending of a deputation to Count Witte
and the entering into negotiations with him will achieve no purpose,
and that, instead, all efforts shall be concentrated upon
organizing Russian Jewry in the struggle for its equality of
citizenship by joining the ranks of the general movement for
liberty.</p></div>

<p>Imbued with the spirit of martyrdom, the Convention remembered
the martyr Dashevski, the avenger of the Kishinev
massacre,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and passed a resolution to convey to the youthful
sufferer, who was then languishing in a penal military company,
its "enthusiastic greetings."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>
<p>In an outburst of national enthusiasm the Convention
adopted the following bold resolution:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the interest of realizing to their full extent the civil, political,
and national rights of the Jewish nationality in Russia, the
Convention resolves as follows:</p>

<p>To proceed without delay to call, on the basis of universal and
equal suffrage, without discrimination of sex, and by a direct
secret vote, an All-Russian Jewish National Assembly in order to
establish, in accordance with the will of the entire Jewish population,
the forms and principles of its national self-determination
as well as the foundations of its internal organization.</p></div>

<p>It was the project of a national Synedrion, radically different
in its conception from the Napoleonic Synedrion convened
in 1807.</p>

<p>The third convention of the "League of Equal Rights" was
held on February 10-13, 1906, during the election campaign to
the first Imperial Duma. The proposal of the Left wing of the
League to boycott the Duma, on the ground that it "will prove
a bulwark of reaction"&mdash;a prediction which was fully justified
by events&mdash;and to refrain from taking part in the elections,
was voted down. On the contrary, a resolution was passed, calling
upon the Jews to take a most active part in the elections, to
nominate everywhere their own Jewish candidates, and, wherever
this was impossible, to give their votes to the non-Jewish
candidates on condition that they pledge themselves to support
in the Duma the civil, political, and national rights of the Jewish
people. The resolution, moreover, contained this clause:
"To insist that the Jewish question in the Duma shall be
settled unconditionally in connection with the fundamental
articles of the Constitution and with the questions of elementary
liberties to be granted to all citizens."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>An election campaign was set in motion and carried on under
the most difficult circumstances. The police authorities took
advantage of the state of war which had been proclaimed in
many places to interfere with a comprehensive pre-election
propaganda, and at the same time the Black Hundred tried to
intimidate the Jews by holding out the menace of pogroms
during the approaching Passover season. In Poland, the anti-Semitic
chauvinists threatened the Jews with all possible
reprisals for their "audacious intention" to nominate their
own candidates for the Duma, alongside of the candidates of the
Christian Poles. Simultaneously, the Jewish group of the
Left, the "Bund" and others, followed the policy of boycotting
the Duma and did their best to interfere with the elections.
However, all these apprehensions proved groundless. The
Passover and election pogroms did not take place, and Russian
Jewry displayed a vigorous activity in the elections, with the
result that twelve Jewish deputies were sent to the first Duma.
The most active among these deputies were M. Vinaver, one
of the leaders of the general Russian Constitutional-Democratic
party and president of the "League for the Attainment of
Equal Rights"; Dr. Shmaryahu Levin, the well-known Zionist;
L. Bramson, actively identified with Jewish educational
activities, who was affiliated with the Russian Democratic
group, known as the <i>Trudoviki</i>, or "Laborites." All the Jewish
deputies were united on the nationalistic platform formulated
by the "League for the Attainment of Equal Rights."
By a resolution passed at the fourth Convention of the League,
held on May 9-13, 1906, they pledged themselves to co-ordinate
their actions in all questions pertaining to Jewish emancipation
and to abide by a common discipline, without, however,
forming a separate parliamentary fraction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>


<h3>4. <span class="smcap">The Jewish Question Before the First Duma</span></h3>

<p>The first Duma was convened on April 27, 1906, and barely
three months later, on July 8, it was dissolved, or rather dispersed
by the Tzar, for having displayed a spirit of excessive
opposition. The prevailing element in the first Duma was the
Constitutional-Democratic majority to which, by their political
sympathies, the bulk of Russian Jewry and ten of its twelve
representatives in the Duma&mdash;the other two stood a little more
to the Left&mdash;belonged. It was natural for the Jews to expect
that a Parliament of this complexion would have no difficulty
in solving the question of equal rights for the Jews
as one of the most fundamental prerequisites of civil liberty.
Unfortunately, this expectation was not justified. The entire
brief session of the Duma was spent in an uninterrupted
struggle of the Opposition with the unscrupulous Government
which was then headed by Goremykin, a hide-bound reactionary.
True, in its reply to the speech from the throne, the
Duma declared that "neither liberty nor order can be firmly
established without the equality of all citizens before the law."
But in the pronouncement of the Government of May 13 no
word was said about this equality of citizenship. The Jewish
deputy Vinaver delivered a powerful speech, in which, among
other things, he spoke as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From this platform, from which so much has been said about
political liberties, we Jews, the representatives of one of the most
tortured nationalities in the land, have not uttered a single word
about ourselves, because we did not consider it seemly to speak
here of civil inequality.... Now, however, it is becoming clear
to us that the Government has made up its mind to continue on
the same road on which it has gone until now, and we are, therefore,
bound to declare that, so long as you will connive at civil
slavery, there will be no peace in the land.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>The mistake made by the Jewish deputies consisted just in
the fact that they had not "uttered a single word" about
themselves on a former occasion, in reply to the speech from
the Throne which had equally failed to make the slightest mention
of civil equality&mdash;practically affecting only the Jews&mdash;and
that they did not utter that word with that feeling of righteous
indignation to which the representatives of "the most tortured
nationality" in Russia were morally entitled.</p>

<p>Later on, the debates in the Duma concerning the Jewish
question were, by the force of events, concentrated upon the
pogrom policy of the Government. On May 8 an interpellation
was introduced regarding the complicity of the Imperial Police
Department in instigating the pogroms of 1905. Stolypin,
the Minister of the Interior, promised to reply to the interpellation,
which was substantiated by documentary evidence, a
month later. But before that term had elapsed a new sanguinary
pogrom broke out in Bialystok.</p>

<p>In this center of the Jewish revolutionary and labor movement,
where, in 1905, the police and troops had already twice
staged a Jewish massacre, a new conspiracy was being hatched
by the police and military against "the authors of the liberty
movement." An accidental act of terrorism, the assassination
of the Chief of Police by an unknown culprit, gave
the police conspirators a proper occasion to execute their
terrible design. On June 1, during a church procession, a
pistol was discharged by an <i>agent provocateur</i> from among
the Black Hundred, and at once a rumor spread like wildfire
among the crowd that "the Jewish anarchists are firing
at the Christians." The pogrom flared up on the spot. In the
course of two days the mob was busy demolishing Jewish houses
and stores and attacking the Jews, while at the same time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
police and military were systematically firing at the Jews not
only on the streets but also in the houses, in which the unfortunate
tried to hide. The bestialities of Kishinev were enacted
again. Entire families were slaughtered, human beings were
tortured, and hacked to pieces; limbs were cut off from the
body, nails driven into the heads.... Eighty dead and
hundreds of wounded Jews were the result of this new exploit
of the counter-revolutionaries.</p>

<p>On June 2, the Imperial Duma received the heart-rending
news of the Bialystok massacre, and right there, after the
passionate speeches of Dr. Levin, Rodichev, and other deputies,
passed a resolution to bring in an interpellation to be answered
by the Government within a fixed date, and to appoint a
parliamentary commission which was to investigate the events
on the spot. Three Duma deputies left at once for Bialystok,
and on their return submitted to the Duma an unvarnished
account which incontrovertibly established the fact that the
Bialystok crime had been carefully prepared as a counter-revolutionary
act, and that the peaceful Jewish population had
been pitilessly shot down by the police and soldiery.</p>

<p>On June 5, three days after the appearance of the bloody
spectre of Bialystok in the Duma hall, a bill dealing with civil
equality for the Jews came up for discussion. The burning
problem involving the disfranchisement of six million human
beings was discussed side by side with the question of a few
petty class discriminations and with the entirely separate question
of women's rights. The entire treatment of the subject by
the deputies showed a distinct lack of warm-hearted sympathy.
Only the speech of the Jewish deputy Levin reverberated with
indignation, when he reminded the Russian Assembly that he
himself, being a Jew, would in ordinary times be denied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
right of residence in the capital, and that, as soon as the Duma
would be dissolved, he, a representative of the people and a
former legislator, would be evicted from St. Petersburg by the
police. The bill was referred to a committee to receive its final
shape.</p>

<p>After an interval of three days, on June 8, the Duma had
again occasion to discuss the subject of pogroms. Premier
Stolypin replied to the interpellation of May 8 concerning the
complicity of the Government in the pogrom of 1905. His
lame attempt to exonerate the authorities called forth a strong
rebuttal from a former member of the Government, the erstwhile
Assistant-Minister of the Interior, Deputy Urussov, who
bravely disclosed the full truth. Fortified by documentary evidence,
he proved the existence of a secret printing-press in the
Police Department which was issuing "patriotic" proclamations
calling upon the populace to exterminate the Jews. He
quoted the words of the gendarmerie officer who was in charge
of that particular activity: "A pogrom may be arranged on
whatever scale you please, whether it be against ten people or
against ten thousand," and he concluded his speech with these
words: "The danger will not disappear, so long as the affairs
of the state and the destinies of the land will be subject to the
influence of people who, by their training, are corporals and
policemen, and by their convictions pogrom makers." These
words were accompanied by a storm of applause, and the
Government bench was showered with cries, "Resign, you
pogrom fiends!" The Duma finally adopted a resolution
echoing these cries of indignation.</p>

<p>A more passionate tone characterized the discussions of the
Duma during the days of June 23-26, in connection with the
report of the parliamentary commission which had been ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>pointed
to investigate the Bialystok massacre. The Duma was
scandalized by the lying official communication, in which the
Jews were put forward as the authors of the pogrom, and by the
shameful military order of the day, in which the troops of the
Bialystok garrison were thanked "for their splendid services
during the time of the pogrom." The speeches delivered by the
Jewish deputies, by Jacobson, who had visited Bialystok as one
of the members of the parliamentary commission, and by
Vinaver and Levin, gave vent to their burning national wrath.
The Russian Mirabeau, Rodichev, pilloried the highly placed
instigators of the Bialystok butchery. On July 7, the Duma
concluded the debate by adopting a resolution denouncing in
violent terms the policy of the Government, a policy of oppression,
frightfulness and extermination, which had created "a
situation unprecedented in the history of civilized countries,"
and demanding, moreover, the immediate resignation of the
reactionary Ministry.</p>


<h3>5. <span class="smcap">The Spread of Anarchy and the Second Duma</span></h3>

<p>Two days later, when the deputies appeared before the Duma,
they found the building closed, and on the doors was displayed
an imperial manifesto dissolving the Duma which "has encroached
upon a domain outside its jurisdiction, and has engaged
in investigating the acts of the authorities appointed by
us." The sudden dissolution of the Duma was answered by
the "Vyborg Manifesto" which was signed by the entire
parliamentary Opposition, calling upon the people to refuse to
pay taxes to furnish soldiers to a Government which had
driven asunder their representatives. The manifesto was also
signed by all the Jewish deputies who subsequently had to pay
for it with imprisonment and the loss of their electoral rights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>The revolutionary terrorism which had subsided during the
sessions of the Duma broke out with redoubled violence after
its dissolution. Attempts upon the lives of high officials&mdash;the
most terrible being the explosion of a bomb in the summer residence
of Stolypin, who had been appointed Prime Minister at
the dissolution of the Duma&mdash;"expropriations," <i>i. e.</i>, the
plunder of state funds and private moneys for revolutionary
purposes, anarchistic labor strikes, were the order of the day.
The Government retorted with monstrous measures of oppression.
A political court-martial was instituted which, in the
course of five months (September, 1906-January, 1907) sentenced
over one thousand people to death, among them many
who were innocent or under age. Needless to say, a considerable
portion of these victims were Jews.</p>

<p>Yet as far as the revolutionary attitude of the Jewish population
was concerned, the Government was not satisfied to cope
with it by "legal" executions, and therefore resorted, in addition,
to the well-tried contrivance of wholesale executions,
in other words, of pogroms. The chief of the political police in
the city of Syedletz, Tikhanovich, engineered on August 27-28
a bloody military pogrom in that city, netting thirty dead and
more than one hundred and fifty wounded Jews. The signal
for the pogrom were shots fired at a sentry by an <i>agent provocateur</i>,
whereupon the troops started an aimless musketry fire
on the streets and even bombarded Jewish houses with grenades.
Many soldiers, in a state of intoxication, committed incredible
barbarities and looted Jewish property. Notwithstanding the
official report of another agent of the local political police,
Captain Pyetukhov, in which he asserted that the Jews had
not given the slightest reason for the butchery and that the
latter had been entirely engineered by the military and political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
authorities, the perpetrator of the pogrom, Tikhanovich, was
not only allowed to go unpunished, but received from the
governor-general of Warsaw an expression of thanks for his
"energy and executive skill."</p>

<p>This being the attitude of the ruling spheres of Russia, it
was out of the question to expect any initiative from that
quarter in regard to the solution of the Jewish question. The
Government of Stolypin, in a circular issued on August 24,
1906, had promised "to find out without delay which restrictions,
being a source of irritation and manifestly obsolete, could
be immediately repealed, and which others, affecting basically
the relationship of the Jewish nationality to the native population,
seem to be a matter of popular conscience, and should
therefore be referred to the legislative institutions." The
Council of Ministers laid before the Tzar a draft of moderate
reforms in favor of the Jews, pointing to the necessity of
appeasing the Jews who, as a result of their grievous restrictions,
"had been forced to carry on a desperate struggle
against the existing order." But these representations had no
effect. Nicholas II. is reported to have said on that occasion:
"So long as I am Tzar, the Zhyds of Russia shall not have
equal rights." During that time, the power of the so-called
"Second Government," the horrible camarilla around the
Tzar, was in the ascendancy, and their mainstay were the Black
Hundred now organized in the reactionary "League of the
Russian People." These reactionary terrorists knew only of
one way to solve the Jewish question&mdash;by exterminating the
Jews.</p>

<p>There was only one ray of hope left&mdash;the second Duma which
was to be convoked in February, 1907. The election campaign
was carried on under Government pressure and was hampered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
by the threat of reprisals and pogroms on the part of the
"Black." The elections resulted in a Duma with an anomalous
complexion. The two extreme wings, the Socialists and Black
Hundred, had gained in strength, whereas the Constitutional
Democratic center had been weakened. The Jews had managed
to elect only three deputies, apart from one Jewish Social-Democrat
who ran on the ticket of his party. They were men of
little renown, whereas of the deputies of the first Duma
who were prosecuted for signing the Vyborg Manifesto not one
was elected.</p>

<p>The entire energy of the new Parliament spent itself
in the struggle between its left and right wing. The Jewish
question was entirely relegated to the "Committee on the
Freedom of Conscience." The Government had brought in a
bill repealing all denominational restrictions, "except those
affecting the Jews," but the Committee decided to eliminate
this discriminating clause and in this manner carry through the
emancipation of the Jews under the guise of the "Freedom of
Conscience."</p>

<p>But this time, too, the hope for Jewish emancipation proved
an illusion. The Duma was soon dissolved, under the pretext
that a revolutionary conspiracy of the Socialistic deputies had
been uncovered. On June 3, 1907, another <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> took
place. The former electoral law which made it possible for the
Russian democracy and the oppressed nationalities to send
their representatives to the Duma was arbitrarily changed by
the Tzar in order to insure a conservative pro-Government
majority in the Russian parliament. There followed an era of
dismal reaction.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII</a><br />

EXTERNAL OPPRESSION AND INTERNAL
CONSOLIDATION</h2>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">The New Alignments Within Russian Jewry</span></h3>

<p>The terrible quadrennium of 1903-1906 had an extraordinarily
quickening effect upon the national and political thought
of the classes as well as of the masses of Russian Jewry. The
year of Kishinev and Homel, when the rightless Jews were
made defenceless; the year of the Russo-Japanese War, when
these rightless and defenceless pariahs were called upon to
fight for their fatherland against the enemy from without; the
year of the revolution when after the sanguinary struggle for
liberty the Jews received a "constitutional charter wrapped up
in pogroms"; finally, the first year of the Duma when indignant
utterances of the Jewish deputies from the platform
of the Duma were accompanied by the moans of the wounded
Jews of Bialystok&mdash;these terrible upheavals might have proved
fatal to Russian Israel had it not, during the preceding period,
worked out for itself a definite <i>nationalistic</i> attitude towards
the non-Jewish world. There were several varieties of this
national-political formula. At the one pole stood Zionism,
with its theory of a new "exodus." At the other pole was the
Social-Democratic party with its premise that "the blood of
the Jew must serve as lubricating oil upon the wheels of the
Russian Revolution." But even these two poles came somewhat
closer to one another at the moment of the great national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
danger, converging, in spite of all their differences in program
and tactics, toward the central line above which floated the
banner proclaiming the fight for the civil, political, and
national rights of the Jewish people. Disfranchised, battered
by pogroms, victimized by tyrannous Tzardom, the Jews of
Russia never thought of degrading themselves to the point of
begging equal rights "in instalments." They demanded their
rights in full, and demanded them not merely as "the Jewish
<i>population</i>," but as the Jewish <i>people</i>, as an autonomous nation
among other nations with a culture of its own. The doctrine of
"National-Cultural Autonomism"<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> was crystallized in definite
slogans. These slogans were proclaimed, as we have seen, by
the "League for the Attainment of Equal Rights for the Jewish
People," which united on its platform all political Jewish
groups, with the exception of the Social-Democratic partisans.</p>

<p>The years of storm and stress also forced Zionism to recede
from its original position of denying the possibility of a
national struggle in the Diaspora. Meeting during the
most exciting days of the Russian Revolution, the Seventh
Zionist Congress at Basle, held in July, 1905, mourned the
loss of its prematurely cut-off leader, Theodor Herzl, and
adopted a resolution voicing its strict allegiance to the Palestine
idea and rejecting the temptations of Territorialism. This
led to a formal split within the party, the Territorialists,
headed by Zangwill, seceding and forming an organization of
their own.</p>

<p>A year later, in November, 1906, the Russian Zionists met at
Helsingfors, and adopted the platform of a "synthetic Zionism,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
that is, a combination of the Palestine idea with the fight
for national and cultural autonomy in the Diaspora. The
guiding resolution of the Zionist Convention was couched in
the following terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Zionist organization of Russia sanctions the affiliation of
the Zionists with the movement for liberty among the territorial
nationalities of Russia, and advocates the necessity of uniting
Russian Jewry upon the principles of the recognition of the
Jewish nationality and its self-government in all the affairs affecting
Jewish national life.</p></div>

<p>This slogan of "national rights" was followed by the Zionists
during the elections to the first Imperial Duma. It was
acted upon to a lesser extent by the two Socialistic factions
affiliated with Zionism, the <i>Poale Zion</i> and the Zionistic
Socialists<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>; both groups confined themselves to the demand of
a minimum of cultural autonomy in the Diaspora, concentrating
their entire energy upon emigration, whether it be into
Palestine, as advocated by the <i>Poale Zion</i>, or into any other
territory, as preached by the Zionistic Socialists. During 1905-1906,
a new Socialistic party with strong nationalistic leanings
came into existence. In distinction from the other two
Socialistic factions, it demanded a maximum of national
autonomy in the Diaspora, including even a Jewish Diet as the
central organ of Jewish self-government. The members of
this party called themselves "Saymists" (from <i>Saym</i>,
"Diet"), or went by the name of the "Jewish Socialistic
Labor Party."</p>

<p>In the midst of all these partisan platforms stood the
"League for the Attainment of Equal Rights for the Jewish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>People," disregarding all party and class affiliations.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> During
the revolutionary period, this organization endeavored to unite
all public-spirited Jews in the general Russian and national
Jewish struggle for liberty, but with the decline of the revolutionary
movement, the centrifugal forces within the League
began to assert themselves. The divergence of views and tactics
among the various groups composing the League proved
stronger than their common interest in the nearest aim, which,
with the advent of the political reaction, had become more
remote.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that, at the beginning of 1907, the
"League for the Attainment of Equal Rights" fell asunder
into its component parts. The first to secede from it was the
Zionist party, which preferred to carry on its own <i>Gegenwartsarbeit</i>
under a separate party flag&mdash;although, properly considered,
a far-reaching activity on behalf of national-Jewish
rejuvenation in the lands of the Diaspora was scarcely compatible
with the fundamental principle of political Zionism,
the "negation of the <i>Golus</i>." The Helsingfors program of
"synthetic Zionism," the child of the liberty movement,
shrank more and more, as the hopes for a Jewish emancipation
in Russia receded into the distance.</p>

<p>Out of the "League for Equal Rights" came further the
"Jewish People's Group," a party which opposed the Zionist
idea altogether and repudiated the attempt to find new Jewish
centers outside of Russia. This group, headed by the well-known
political leader, M. Vinaver, placed in the center of its
program the fight for civil emancipation, in close contact with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the progressive elements of the Russian people, whereas in the
question of national-Jewish interests it confined itself to the
principle of "self-determination" and to the freedom of
Jewish culture in general outlines, without putting forward
concrete demands of Jewish autonomy. The People's Group
counted among its adherents many representatives of the
Jewish <i>intelligenzia</i> who had more or less discarded the idea of
assimilation and had come to recognize the necessity of a minimum
of "Jewish-national rights."</p>

<p>The third group, which also took its rise in the "League for
Equal Rights," and received the name <i>Volkspartei</i>, or Jewish
National Party, stood firmly on the platform of national Jewish
policies. The underlying principle of this organization, or,
more correctly, of this far-reaching social current, which has
its origin in the historic development of the Jewish people,
was the same principle of national-cultural autonomism which
had long before the revolution pursued its own line of development
parallel to Zionism.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The simultaneous struggle for civil
and national rights, the creation of a full-fledged national community,
instead of the <i>Kultusgemeinde</i> of Western Europe,
an autonomous national school, and the rights of both languages,
the Hebrew and the Yiddish&mdash;such was, in general outlines,
the program of the <i>Volkspartei</i>. At the same time, this
party, taking the historic idea of the transplantation of Jewish
centers in the Diaspora as its point of departure, recognized
the emigration to America and the colonization of Palestine as
great national factors destined to create two new centers of
Judaism, one quantitatively powerful center in North America,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
and a smaller national center, but qualitatively, from the
point of view of cultural purity, more valuable, in Palestine.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Finally, the "League for Equal Rights" gave birth to a
fourth party, the Jewish Democratic Group, which is distinguished
from the People's Group by its stronger leaning
towards the political parties of the Left, the Russian radicals
and Socialists.</p>

<p>Since the dissolution of the "League," these four groups
have, as a rule, united in various coalitions. They are all represented
on the permanent council at St. Petersburg which,
together with the deputies of the Imperial Duma, discusses
Jewish political questions as they arise from time to time.
Thus, there emerged in Jewish public life a form of representation
reflecting the national and political ideas which
had assumed concrete shape during the years of the Russian
revolution and counter-revolution. The only organization
standing outside these federated groups and their common
platform of national Jewish politics is the Jewish Social-Democratic
party, known as the "Bund," which is tied down
by its class program and is barred by it from co-operating with
the bourgeoisie, or a non-class organization, even within the
domain of national Jewish interests.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The Triumph of the "Black Hundred"</span></h3>

<p>All these strivings and slogans were severely hit by the
<i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> of June 3, 1907, when a large part of what the
revolution had achieved was rendered null and void. Owing
to the amendment of the suffrage law by this clumsy act of
autocratic despotism, the constitution became the handmaid
of Tzardom. The ruling power slipped into the hands of the
Black Hundred, the extreme monarchistic groups, which
were organized in the "League of the Russian People" and
openly advocated the restoration of autocracy. The head of the
League, Dubrovin, congratulated the emperor upon his act of
violence of June 3, and was assured in reply that henceforth
the "League of the Russian People" would be the "trusted
bulwark" of the Throne. Nicholas might have said with
greater justification that the Throne was the bulwark of the
League of the Black Hundred, the hirelings of the reaction,
who were supplied with millions of rubles from the imperial
counter-revolutionary fund, the so-called "black money."
Street heroes and pogrom perpetrators became the masters of
Russian politics. The sinister forces began the liquidation of
the emancipation movement. Day after day the newspaper
columns were crammed with reports concerning the arrests of
politically "undependable" persons and the executions of
revolutionaries. The gallows and the jails became, as it were,
the emblems of governmental authority. The spectacle of
daily executions which continued for two years (1907-1909)
forced from the breast of the grand old man, Leo Tolstoi, the
desperate cry: "I cannot keep silent."</p>

<p>Yet Nicholas II. continued his r&ocirc;le of hangman. While
young men and women, among them a great number of Jews,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
met their fate on the scaffold, the rioters and murderers from
among the Black Hundred, who during the days of October,
1905, alone had ruined hundreds of Jewish communities, remained
unpunished. The majority of them were not even put
on trial, for the local authorities who were charged with that
duty were afraid lest the judicial inquiry might establish their
own complicity in the pogroms. But even those who were
prosecuted and convicted on the charge of murder and plunder
were released from punishment by orders from St. Petersburg.
As a rule, the local branch of the League of the Russian People
would appeal to the Tzar to pardon the participants in the
"patriotic demonstrations"&mdash;the official euphemism for anti-Jewish
riots&mdash;and the invariable response was an immediate
pardon which was ostentatiously published in the newspapers.
The petitions to the Tzar applying for the pardon of convicted
perpetrators of violence went regularly through the Minister
of Justice, the ferocious reactionary and anti-Semite Shcheglovitov.
No one doubted that this amnesty was granted by
virtue of an agreement concluded in 1905 between the Government
and the pogrom ringleaders, guaranteeing immunity
to the anti-Jewish rioters.</p>

<p>A different treatment was meted out to the Jewish self-defence
contingents, which had the courage to oppose the
murderers. They were dealt with ruthlessly. In Odessa, a
court-martial sentenced six young Jews, members of a self-defence
group which was active during the October pogroms,
to long terms of hard labor, characterizing the "crime" of
these Jews in the following words: "For having participated
in a conspiracy having for its object the overthrow of the
existing order by means of arming the Jewish proletariat for
an attack upon the police and troops." This characterization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
was not far from the mark. The men engaged in defending the
lives of their brothers and sisters against the murderous hordes
were indeed guilty of a criminal offence against the "existing
order," since the latter sought its support in these hordes, of
whom "the police and troops," as was shown by the judicial
inquiries, had formed a part. The appeal taken from this
judgment to the highest military court was dismissed and the
sentence sustained (August, 1907). The Jews who had done
nothing beyond defending life and property could expect
neither pardon nor mitigation. This lurid contrast between
the release of the pogrom perpetrators and the conviction of
the pogrom victims was interpreted as a direct challenge to the
Jewish population on the part of Nicholas II. and his frenzied
accomplices.</p>

<p>The Black Hundred had a right to feel that it was their
day. They knew that the League of the Russian People formed,
to use the phrase then frequently applied to it in the press, a
"Second Government," which wielded greater power than the
official quasi-constitutional Government of Stolypin. The
dregs of the Russian populace gave full vent to their base
instincts. In Odessa, hordes of League members made it a
regular practice to assault the Jews upon the streets with
rubber sticks, and, in case of resistance, to fire at them with
pistols. Grigoryev, the city-governor, one of the few honest
administrators, who made an attempt to restrain this black
terrorism, was dismissed in August, 1907,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> with the result that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the assaults upon the Jews in the streets assumed an even more
sanguinary character. All complaints of the Jews were dismissed
by the authorities with the remark: "All this is taking
place because the Jews were most prominent in the revolution."</p>

<p>The Government represented by Stolypin, which was anxious
to save at least the appearance of a constitutional r&eacute;gime, was
often forced to give way before the secret Government of the
Black League, which commanded the full sympathy of the
Tzar. By orders of the League, Stolypin decreed that one
hundred Jewish students who had passed the competitive examination
at the Kiev Polytechnicum should be excluded from
that institution and that a like number of Russian students who
had failed to pass should be admitted instead. The director
and dean of the institution protested against this clumsy violation
of academic freedom, but their protest was left unheeded,
whereupon they tendered their resignation (September,
1907). Following upon this, the Ministry of Public Instruction,
yielding to the pressure of the "Second Government,"
restored the shameful percentage norm, restricting the admission
of Jews to institutions of higher learning, which, during
the preceding years, had been disregarded by the autonomous
professorial councils.</p>

<p>About the same time the Senate handed down a decision declaring
the Zionist organization, which had been active in
Russia for many years, to be illegal, and giving full scope
to the police authorities to proceed with repressive measures
against the members of the movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>


<h3>3. <span class="smcap">The Third, or Black, Duma</span></h3>

<p>Such was the atmosphere which surrounded the elections to
the third Imperial Duma in the fall of 1907. The reactionary
electoral law of June 3 barred from the Russian Parliament the
most progressive and democratic elements of the Empire.
Moreover, by splitting the electoral assemblies into class and
national curias, the Government succeeded in preventing the
election of any considerable number of Jewish deputies. The
elections took place under severe pressure from the authorities.
Many "dangerous" nominees of the Left were arbitrarily put
under arrest on framed-up political charges and, pending the
conclusion of the investigation, were temporarily barred from
running for office. In some places, the Black Hundred openly
threatened the Jews with pogroms, if they dared to nominate
their own candidates. As a result, only two Jewish deputies
managed to get into the Duma&mdash;Friedman from the government
of Kovno, and Nisselovich from Courland.</p>

<p>The third Duma, nicknamed the Black, assembled in November,
1907. It had an overwhelming majority of reactionaries
and anti-Semites. This majority of the Right was made up of
the coalition of the conservative Center, represented by the
"Octobrist" party,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> with the extreme Right wing, the Russian
"Nationalists," and Black Hundred. Whenever the Jewish
question came up for discussion, the reactionary bloc was
always able to drown the voices of the weak opposition, the
"Cadet" party (Constitutional Democrats), the <i>Trudoviki</i>
("the Labor Party"), and the handful of Socialists.</p>

<p>The attitude of this reactionary Duma toward the Jewish
question was revealed at its early sessions when the bill concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the inviolability of the person was the subject of discussion.
The opposition demanded the establishment of the full freedom
of movement as the most fundamental condition of the inviolability
of the person, but the majority of the Right managed to
insert in the bill the following stipulation: "No one shall be
limited in the right of choosing his place of residence and in
moving from place to place, except in the cases set forth in the
law, and excepting the Jews who arrive in localities situated
outside the Pale of Settlement" (1908). In this wise the Russian
legislators cleverly succeeded in harmonizing the principle
of the inviolability of the person with the life-long imprisonment
of millions of people in the huge prison house known as
the Pale of Settlement.</p>

<p>Their solicitude for the maintenance of this vast ghetto
was so intense that the reactionary Government of Stolypin
was often the butt of criticism because it did not always show
sufficient regard for this holy institution. The fact of the
matter was that in May, 1907, Stolypin had issued a circular
ordering the governors to stop the expulsion from the interior
governments of those Jews who had settled there before
August, 1906, and possessed "a family and a domestic establishment"
in those provinces, provided they were "harmless
to the public order and do not arouse the dissatisfaction of
the Christian population." As a result of this circular, several
hundred, possibly several thousand, Jewish families were
saved from expulsion. In consequence, the Right brought in
an interpellation calling upon the Government to explain on
what ground it had dared to issue this "charter of privileges"
to the Jews. The interpellation, of course, proved effective,
and the Government did its utmost to nullify the exemptive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
provisions of the circular. The anti-Semitic Duma betrayed
the same spirit on another occasion by rejecting in the same
year (1908) the bill, introduced by the Opposition, conferring
the right of visiting the health resorts or watering-places upon
all sufferers, without distinction of nationality.</p>

<p>Yet these legal discriminations were not the worst feature
of the third Duma. Even more excruciating was the way in
which the Right wing of the Russian Parliament permitted
itself to make sport of Judaism and things Jewish. It almost
seemed as if the devotees of autocracy, the members of the extreme
Right, had come to the Russian Parliament for the
express purpose of showering abuse not only on the Russian
constitution but also on parliamentary government in general.
The hirelings of Nicholas II. danced like a horde of savages
over the dead body of the emancipation movement, singing
hymns in praise of slavery and despotism. Creatures of the
street, the reactionary deputies drenched the tribune of the Imperial
Duma with mud and filth, and, when dealing with the
Jews, they resorted to methods similar to those which were in
vogue among their accomplices upon the streets of the devastated
cities. The term <i>Zhyd</i> and the adjective <i>Zhydovski</i>, in
addition to other scurrilous epithets, became the most favored
terms of their vocabulary. They inserted formulas and
amendments in various bills submitted to the Duma which
were deliberately intended to insult the Jews. They called
upon the Ministry of War to bring in a bill excluding the Jews
from the army, in view of the fact that the Jewish soldiers had
proved an element "which corrupts the army in the time of
peace and is extremely unreliable in the time of war" (1908).
They supported a law barring the Jews from the military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Academy of Medicine, on the ground that the Jewish surgeons
had carried on a revolutionary propaganda in the army
during the Russo-Japanese War (1910). The Octobrists
demanded the exclusion of the Jews from the office of Justice
of the Peace, for the reason that their admission was subversive
of the principles of a "Christian State" (1909).
The remark made on that occasion by Karaulov, a deputy of
the Opposition, "Where there is no equality, where there are
pariah nationalities, there is no room for a constitutional
order," was met from the benches of the Right with the retort:
"Thank God for it; we don't want it." A similar cynical
outburst of laughter greeted the warning of Rodichev:
"Without the abolition of the Jewish disabilities, there is no
access to the Temple of Freedom."</p>

<p>The two Jewish Duma deputies did their utmost to get a
hearing, but the Black Hundred generally interrupted their
speeches by wild and offensive exclamations. In 1910, the
Jewish deputy Nisselovich succeeded in obtaining the signatures
of one hundred and sixty-six deputies for a legal draft,
abrogating the Pale of Settlement. It was laid before the
Duma, but resulted merely in fruitless debates. It was referred
to a committee which quietly strangled the bill.</p>


<h3>4. <span class="smcap">New Jewish Disabilities</span></h3>

<p>Spurred on by the reactionary Duma, the Government went
to even greater lengths in its policy of Jewish discrimination.
Premier Stolypin, who was getting constantly nearer to the
Right, was entirely oblivious of the promise, made by him in
1905, to remove immediately all restrictions which are "the
source of irritation and are manifestly obsolete." On the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>trary,
the Ministry presided over by him was systematically
engaged in inventing new grievous disabilities. The Jewish
deputy Friedman was fully justified in declaring, in a speech
delivered in February, 1910, that even "during the most terrible
time which the Jews had to live through under Plehve no
such cruelties and barbarities were practised as at the present
moment." Wholesale expulsions of Jews from the cities situated
outside the Pale of Settlement and from the villages
within the Pale assumed the character of an epidemic. In the
spring of 1910 the Government decided on sacrificing to the
Moloch of Jew-hatred a whole hecatomb by expelling twelve
hundred Jewish families from Kiev&mdash;a measure which aroused
a cry of indignation beyond the confines of Russia. The acts of
the Government were marked by a refinement of cruelty, for
even little children, invalids, and aged people were pitilessly
evicted. Particular enmity was shown in the ejection of Jews
who had committed the "crime" of visiting summer resorts
outside the city lines. The Senate handed down a decision to
the effect that the Jewish soldiers who had participated in the
defence of the besieged fortress of Port Arthur during the
Japanese War were not entitled to the right of residence which
had been granted by a former decree<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> to the Jewish soldiers
who had taken part in the war.</p>

<p>The spiritual murder of Jewish school children was the
function of the black Minister of Enlightenment, with the
significant name of Schwartz. The school norm, which, before
the revolution, had been applied merely as a Government order,
without legislative sanction, was formulated by him into a law
and ratified by the Tzar in September, 1908. Henceforth, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
institutions of higher learning in the Empire were open to the
Jews only in a proportion not exceeding three per cent. of the
total number of students for the capitals, five per cent. for the
educational establishments outside the Pale, and ten per
cent. for the Pale of Settlement. In view of the fact that
during the emancipation movement the influx of Jews to
the higher schools had been very great, so that their number
was now vastly in excess of the established norm, it would
have become necessary for the higher schools to bar completely
all new candidates until the number of Jewish students had
been reduced to the prescribed percentage limits. For a while
the Minister recoiled from taking this cruel step, and permitted
for the next few years the admission of Jewish students
within the limits of the percentage norm, calculating the latter
in relation to the number of the <i>newly admitted</i> Christian students
during a given year, without regard to the Jewish
students admitted previously. Subsequently, however, many
educational institutions closed their doors completely to the
Jews, referring, by way of explanation, to the "completion
of the norm" by the former pupils. Once more, bands of the
"martyrs of learning" could be seen wending their ways
toward the universities in foreign lands.</p>

<p>A year later, in 1909, the percentage restrictions governing
the secondary schools were also placed on the statute books.
The proportion of Jewish admissions was fixed between five
and fifteen per cent.&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, slightly in excess of the old norm&mdash;and
was extended in its application to private educational institutions
with the prerogatives of government schools. This
law spelled ruin to many gymnazia and schools of commerce
which, though directed by Christians, were almost entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
dependent on Jewish support, eighty per cent. of their school
population consisting of Jews. As for the gymnazia maintained
by Jews, with very few exceptions, they never were able
to obtain from the Ministry the status of government institutions.</p>

<p>The educational Hamans, however, went a step further,
and in March, 1911, secured an ukase of the Tzar extending the
percentage norm to the "externs":<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> henceforward Jews were
to be admitted to the examination for the "certificate of
maturity"<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> or for the completion of a part of the curriculum
only in a certain proportion to the number of Christian externs.
In point of fact, however, there were no Christian externs, since
only the Jews who had failed to find admission to the schools
were forced to present themselves for examination as externs.
In consequence, the enormous number of Jewish children who
had been barred from the schools by the percentage norm
were deprived of their right to receive a testimonial from a
secondary school. This law was passed during a brief interruption
in the sessions of the Duma and was never submitted to
it. The deputies of the Opposition brought in an interpellation
concerning this action, but the "Black Parliament" laid
the matter on the table, and the law which lacked all legal
basis went into operation.</p>

<p>Swayed more and more by the tendencies of a reactionary
Russian nationalism, Stolypin's Government set out to uproot
the national-cultural institutions of the "alien" races in
Russia. The Poles, the Finns, and other nationalities became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>the victims of this policy. The lash of oppression was also
applied to Jewish cultural life. In 1910, Stolypin issued a
circular impressing Russian officialdom with the idea that the
cultural and educational societies of the "aliens" contributed
towards arousing in them "a narrow national-political self-consciousness"
and towards "the strengthening of national
separatism," and that for this reason all the societies of the
Ukrainians and Jews which were established for the purpose
of fostering a separate national culture should be prohibited.</p>


<h3>5. <span class="smcap">The Spiritual Revival of Russian Jewry</span></h3>

<p>This new blow was aimed right at the heart of Judaism.
For after the revolution, when the political struggle had subsided,
the Jewish <i>intelligenzia</i> directed its entire energy into
the channel of national-cultural endeavors. Profiting by the
law of 1906, granting the freedom of assemblies and meetings,
they founded everywhere cultural, educational, and economic
(co-operative and credit) societies. In 1908, the Jewish
Literary Society was established in St. Petersburg, which
soon counted over a hundred branches in the provinces.
The same year saw the formation of the Jewish Historico-Ethnographic
Society which began to publish a quarterly review
under the name <i>Yevreyskaya Starina</i> ("Jewish Antiquity").<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
The oldest educational organization among the Jews,
the Society for the Diffusion of Enlightenment, enlarged its
activity and was endeavoring to create a new type of national
Jewish school.</p>

<p>A multitude of other cultural societies and circles sprang
into life with the sanction of the authorities throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
length and breadth of the Pale. Everywhere lectures and conferences
were held and heated debates were carried on, centering
around national-cultural problems. Particularly passionate
were the discussions about the position of Hebrew and
Yiddish in public life, in school and in literature, leading to
the alignment of two parties, the Hebraists and the Yiddishists.
The lectures, conferences and debates themselves were generally
carried on in one of these languages, mostly in the
Yiddish vernacular.</p>

<p>In spite of their crudities, these partisan conflicts were
a clear indication of the advance of national self-consciousness
and of the desire for the upbuilding of a genuine Jewish life
upon the concrete foundations of a cultural autonomy. Of
course, anti-Semitic Tzardom could not be expected to sympathize
with this inner regeneration of Jewry, and, as in the
time of Plehve, it directed its blow at the Jewish-national
organizations. Here and there the blow was effective. In 1911,
the Jewish Literary Society, with its one hundred and twenty
branches, which had displayed an energetic activity in the
establishment of libraries and the arrangement of public lectures,
went out of existence. In general, however, the attacks
directed against the Jewish spirit proved much more difficult
of realization than the attacks upon Jewish property. The
cultural activities continued in their course, defying all external
restrictions and persecutions.</p>

<p>The literary revival, which had started in the nineties, and
was but temporarily interrupted by the stormy events of the
revolutionary period, also came into its own again. The
rejuvenation of both the national and the popular language,
finding its expression in a widely ramified Jewish literature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
proceeded along paralleled lines. The periodical press in Hebrew,
represented by the two dailies, <i>ha-Tzefirah</i> in Warsaw,
and <i>ha-Zeman</i> in Vilna, and the monthly ha-Shiloah in
Odessa, found its counterpart in a popular press in Yiddish,
reaching hundreds of thousands of readers, such as the dailies
<i>Fraind</i> ("The Friend," published since 1903 in St. Petersburg),
<i>Haint</i> ("To-day"), <i>Moment</i>, and others, in Warsaw.
In addition there was the Jewish press in Russian: the weeklies
<i>Voskhod</i>, <i>Razsvyet</i>, <i>Yevreyski Mir</i> in St. Petersburg, and
a few other publications.</p>

<p>In the domain of higher literary productivity, new forces
were being constantly added to the old ones. Besides the great
national bard Bialik there appeared a number of gifted poets:
Shneor, the singer of "storm and stress," of doubts and negations,
the romantically inclined Jacob Kohan, Fichman,
Reisin, David Einhorn, and many other youthful, as yet
scarcely unfolded talents. J. L. Perez found a rival in Shalom
Asch, the portrayer of patriarchal Jewish life in the provincial
towns of Poland (<i>Die St&auml;dtel</i>, "The Provincial Town," 1904),
and the author of charming sketches from Jewish life, as well as
a playwright of note whose productions have met with tumultuous
applause both on the Jewish and the non-Jewish stage
(<i>Moshiah's Zeiten</i>, "Messianic Times," <i>Gott von Nekomo</i>,
"God of Revenge," <i>Shabbetai Zewi</i>, <i>Yihus</i>, "Blue Blood").
His numerous co-workers in Yiddish letters have devoted themselves
with youthful enthusiasm to the cultivation of this
branch of Jewish literature.</p>

<p>In Hebrew fiction a number of talented writers and a group
of novelists, who publish their works mostly in the <i>ha-Shiloah</i>,
came to the fore. The successor of Ahad Ha'am in the editor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>ship
of this periodical, Dr. Joseph Klausner, occupies a prominent
place in Jewish literature as publicist, critic, and partly
as historian. If we add to these talents the not inconsiderable
number of writers who are domiciled in Galicia, Palestine,
Germany, and America, and draw their inspiration from the
vast Russian-Jewish reservoir, the growth of Jewish literature
during the last decade stands forth in bold relief.</p>

<p>This progress of inner Jewish life in Russia is truly remarkable.
In spite of the catastrophes which have descended upon
Russian Jewry during the first decade of the twentieth century,
the productivity of the Jewish national spirit has gone on unchecked,
and the national-Jewish culture has struck out in all
directions. The assimilationist positions, which have been
generally abandoned, are only held by a few loyal devotees
of a past age. It is true that the process of <i>elemental</i> assimilation,
which penetrates from the surrounding atmosphere
into Judaism through the medium of language, school
and literature continues to affect Jewish life with the same
force as of old. But there can be no doubt that it is effectively
counterbalanced by the centripetal factor of a national culture
which is becoming more and more powerful. Large as is the
number of religious apostates who have deserted Judaism under
the effect of external pressure, and of moral renegades who have
abandoned the national ethical ideals of Judaism in favor of a
new-fangled decadent &aelig;stheticism, it is negligible when compared
with the compact mass of Russian Jewry and with the
army of intellectuals whose national self-consciousness has been
deepened by suffering. As in all previous critical moments in
the history of the Jews, the spirit of the nation, defying its
new tormentors, has grown stronger in the worn-out body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
The Hamans of Russia who have attempted to crush the
Eternal People have failed as signally as their predecessors in
Persia, Syria and Byzantium.</p>

<h2>RUSSIAN JEWRY SINCE 1911</h2>


<p>Being loath to cross the threshold of the present, we shall
stop at the year 1911, terminating the first decade of the
Thirty Years' War waged by Russian Tzardom against
Jewry since 1881. The more recent phases of this war
are still fresh in our memory. To put the new campaign
of Jew-hatred in its proper light, it will suffice to point out
its most conspicuous landmarks which stand out by their extraordinarily
sinister features. In 1911, the organizations
of the Black Hundred, with the help of their accomplices
in the Duma and in the Government circles, manufactured
the monstrous "Beilis case." The murder of a Russian
boy in Kiev, of a family belonging to a band of thieves,
and the discovery of the body in the neighborhood of a brickkiln
owned by a Jew provided the anti-Semites with an opportunity
to bring forward the old charge of ritual murder. In the
beginning the Government was somewhat uncertain as to the
attitude it should adopt towards the mysterious Kiev murder.
But a political occurrence which took place at the time put
an end to its vacillation. In September, 1911, Premier
Stolypin was assassinated in a Kiev theatre in the presence of
the Tzar and the dignitaries of State. The assassin, by the
name of Bogrov, proved to be the son of a lawyer who was of
Jewish extraction, though he had long before turned his back
upon his people&mdash;a semi-anarchist, who at one time had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
active as police agent for some mysterious revolutionary purposes.
The Jewish extraction of the father of the assassin was
enough to produce a paroxysm of fury in the camp of the
anti-Semitic reactionaries who had lost in the person of
Stolypin an exalted patron. In Kiev preparations were openly
made for a Jewish massacre, but the Government was afraid
that the proposed wholesale execution of Jews would mar the
festive solemnity of the Tzar's visit to Kiev. The authorities
made it known that the Tzar was not in favor of riots, and a
bloody street pogrom was averted.</p>

<p>In its place, however, a bloodless pogrom, extending over
two years, was arranged in the form of the Beilis case. Minister
of Justice Shcheglovitov, a former Liberal, who had become
a fanatical partisan of the Black Hundred, made up his mind
to impart to the trial a glaring ritual coloring. The original
Judicial inquiry having failed to uncover any traces of Jewish
complicity, the Minister of Justice ordered a new special inquiry
and constantly changed the personnel of the investigating
and prosecuting officials, until he finally secured a bill of
indictment in which the whole case was represented as a
ritual crime, committed by the Jew Beilis with the participation
of "undiscovered persons."</p>

<p>For two years, the Beilis case provided the pabulum for a
wild anti-Semitic campaign which was carried on among the
so-called better classes, on the streets, in the press, and in the
Imperial Duma. The court trial which took place in Kiev in
October, 1913, was expected to crown with success the criminal
design harbored by the Minister of Justice and the Black Hundred,
but the expectations of the Government were disappointed.
In spite of a carefully selected court personnel, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
consisted of anti-Semitic judges representing the Crown, and
of sworn jurymen, ignorant peasants and burghers who believed
in the ritual murder legend, Beilis was acquitted, and
the authorities found it impossible to fasten the guilt upon the
Jews.</p>

<p>Exasperated by the failure, the Government wreaked its vengeance
upon the liberal-minded intellectuals and newspaper
men, who, by their agitation against the hideous libel, had
wrested the prey from the hands of the Black Hundred. Scores
of legal actions were instituted not only against newspaper
editors and contributors but also against the St. Petersburg
Bar Association, which had adopted a resolution protesting
against the method pursued by Shcheglovitov in the Beilis
trial. The sensational case against the metropolitan lawyers
was tried in June, 1914, one month before the declaration of
the World War, and terminated in a verdict of guilty for
twenty-five lawyers, on the charge of "having agitated against
the Government."</p>

<p>The triennium preceding the World War witnessed the rise
of a new danger for Judaism, this time coming from Poland.
The extraordinary intensity of the national and religious
sentiment of the Poles, accentuated by the political oppression
which for more than a hundred years had been inflicted upon
them, particularly by the hands of Russian despotism, has, during
the last decade, been directed against the Jewish people.
The economic progress made by the Jews in the two industrial
centers of Russian Poland, in Warsaw and Lodz, gave rise to
the boycott agitation. Polish anti-Semites proclaimed the
slogan "Do not buy from Jews!", aiming the cry specifically
against the "Litvaks," that is, the hundreds of thousands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Russian Jews who, in the course of the last few decades,
had been chiefly instrumental in the economic advancement of
those two centers. The cloak beneath which this agitation was
carried on was purely that of Polish nationalism: the Russian
Jews were alleged, on the one hand, "to Russify Poland," and,
accused, on the other hand, of an opposite tendency, of asserting
themselves as the members of a separate Jewish nationality,
with a press and a social organization of their own,
which refuses to be merged in the Polish people.</p>

<p>The anti-Semitic movement in Poland, which began
shortly after the revolution of 1905, assumed extraordinary
dimensions in 1910-1911, when the boycott became a fierce
economic pogrom, reaching its culmination in 1912, during the
election campaign to the fourth Imperial Duma. The Jewish
electors of Warsaw formed a majority, and were, therefore, in
a position to send a Jewish deputy to the Duma. Yet out of
consideration for the national susceptibilities of the Poles who
insisted on sending as a representative of the Polish capital
one of their "own," a Christian, the Jews were willing to
accept a Polish candidate, provided the latter was not an anti-Semite.
When, however, the Polish election committee, disregarding
the feelings of the Jews, nominated the anti-Semitic
candidate Kukhazhevski, the Jews gave their votes
to the Polish Socialistic nominee Yaghello, who carried the
election. This attitude of the Jews aroused a storm of
indignation among the higher classes of Polish society. An
anti-Jewish campaign, marked by extraordinary bitterness,
was set in motion, and in the press and on the streets the Jews
were nicknamed "Beilises," an echo of the ritual murder
legend which had given rise to such horrors in ancient Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Poland. The economic boycott was carried on with incredible
fury, and in a number of towns and villages the cowardly
enemies of the Jews, being afraid of attacking them openly,
set fire to Jewish houses, with the result that in many cases
entire families were consumed in the flames.</p>

<p>The <i>furor Polonicus</i> assumed more and more dangerous
forms, so that at the beginning of the World War, in 1914,
almost the entire Polish nation, from the "progressive anti-Semites"
down to the clericals, were up in arms against the
Jews. From this armed camp came the defiant war cry: "On
the banks of the Vistula there is no room for two nationalities,"
thus sentencing to death the two millions of Polish Jewry
who consider themselves a part of the Jewish, and not of the
Polish nation. Out of this soil of national hatred crawled forth
the snake of the terrible "military libel," which during the
first year of the war drenched Polish Jewry in rivers of blood.
Over the bleeding body of the Jewish people Polish and Russian
anti-Semitism joined hands. Horrors upon horrors were
perpetrated before which the ancient annals of Jewish martyrdom
fade into insignificance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nearly twenty centuries have passed since the ancient
Jud&aelig;o-Hellenic Diaspora sent forth a handful of men who established
a Jewish colony upon the northern Scythian, now
Russian, shores of the Black Sea. More than a thousand years
ago the Jews of Byzantium from one direction, and those of the
Arabian Caliphate from another, went forth to colonize the
land of the Scythians. The Jew stood at the cradle of ancient
Kiovian Russia, which received Christianity from the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
of the Byzantines. The Jew witnessed the birth of Catholic
Poland, and, during the stormy days of the Crusades, fled from
the West of Europe to this haven of refuge which was not
yet entirely in the hands of the Catholic Church. He has
seen Poland in its bloom and decay; he has witnessed the rise
of Muscovite Russia, tying the fate of one-half of his nation
to the new Russian Empire. Here the power that dominates
history opened up before the Jewish people a black abyss of
medi&aelig;valism in the midst of the blazing light of modern civilization,
and finally threw it into the flames of the gigantic
struggle of nations. What may the World War be expected to
bring to the World-Nation? Full of agitation, the Jew is looking
into the future, and the question of his ancient prophet
is trembling on his lips: "Ah Lord God! wilt Thou make a full
end of the remnant of Israel?"<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.... Let the entire past of
the Jewish people serve as an answer to this question&mdash;a people
which, in the maelstrom of human history, has succeeded in
conquering the two cosmic forces: Time and Space.</p>
